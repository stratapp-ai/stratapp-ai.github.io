  ### your time-to-value is days

  1 day to set-up.

  3 weeks to achieve digital transformation, on clear ground rules that include leading by example and eliminating internal email.

  Start with one grouping of 10 to 100 people.  After 3 weeks, roll out progressively by level, function or geography.

  Rely on peer-to-peer coaching and viral adoption, or run an in-house training program, or engage our coaching partner.

  Roll out in 4 easy phases, explained [here](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/how-to-implement/ "how to implement").

  Your time-to-value on #stratapp is days - not weeks or months.

  ### execution rarely meets expectations

  For 30 years strategy formation, communication and execution has been flawed.

  The age old paradigms of static docs and top down control are holding us back.  As a result, executing strategy has rarely met expectations.

  It is time we fixed this.

  We have created a seamless user experience for executing both strategic and day-to-day work, in one place.

  We did not invent new management buzz words, theory or methods. We have carefully designed #stratapp on what you already know.

  Your time-to-value on #stratapp is days - not weeks or months.
