  ### time-to-value is fast, real fast

  1 day to set-up.

  3 weeks to achieve genuine and sustainable digital transformation, on clear ground rules that include leading by example and eliminating internal email.

  Start with one grouping of 10 to 100 people.  After 3 weeks, roll out progressively by level, function or geography.

  Rely on peer-to-peer coaching and viral adoption, or run an in-house training program, or engage our coaching partner.

  Roll out in 4 easy phases, explained [here](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/how-to-implement/ "how to implement").

  Your time-to-value on #stratapp is days - not weeks or months.

  ### execution rarely meets expectations

  For 30 years strategy formation, communication and execution has been flawed.

  The age old paradigm of top-down static docs doesn't work.  For most organizations, executing strategy rarely meets expectations.

  It is time we fixed this.

  \#stratapp has created a seamless experience for executing both strategic and day-to-day work, in one place, in one simple app.

  We didn't invent new buzz words, theories or methods. We carefully designed the experience around what you already know.

  Your time-to-value on #stratapp is days - not weeks or months.
