You should be up and running on #stratapp within 2 cups of coffee, which is a far cry from the weeks or months it usually takes to deploy business software.

# NO NEED FOR BIG BANG

One beauty of #stratapp is that you can do the roll out progressively, selecting who sees what pages in the app, right down to each individual employee.

This means you can immediately go org-wide with the quick win "productivity & culture" elevation features, whilst preparing content for strategy and KPIs.

Clients usually start as either:

* Org-wide - for the "productivity & culture" features
* Top down - top 3 layers - the CEO/owner, each direct report and their next layer of direct reports
* Functions - one function at a time
* Geography - one geography at a time

## no or minimal end user training

If you use manage pages to roll out the rich functionality progressively, you should not need end user training.

\#stratapp is intuitive and best learnt by doing.

\#stratapp’s UX has been designed for all generations, tech aptitudes and frequencies of use. Like all modern collaboration tech, end user proficiency requires a little patience, some experimentation and an open mind.

## two roles for success

Most clients establish two roles:

1. Power Users - who manage settings and become the go-to people on how to use #stratapp
2. Sponsors - who lead the cultural shift to org-wide engagement, collaboration, [transparency](https://stratapp.ai/blog/radical-transparency/ "radical transparency") and [eliminating internal email](https://stratapp.ai/blog/what-is-really-going-on-in-my-company/ "eliminating internal email")

# MANAGE PAGES FOR PROGRESSIVE ROLL OUTS

It is wonderful that #stratapp is 10 apps in 1. That said, we recommend deploying #stratapp progressively.

## productivity & culture

The easy quick wins are to start with these five core features for elevating productivity and culture.

### @org-design

Imagine you want to send a message, ask a question or invite to a task or workboard, everyone who is in:

* @G/APAC/Australia/Queensland - the geography of Queensland in Australia
* @F/Marketing/Digital - the Digital team within the Marketing function
* @L<3 - more senior than level 3 on the Live Org Chart

That takes about 4 seconds to do inside #stratapp, and you can even do it as AND or OR.

Imagine the power of this unique @org-design feature for productivity and collaboration, compared to old school email address lists and having to know the recipients actual name in order to collaborate with them.

### social with structure

Most business apps have built-in social. However #stratapp has [social with structure](https://stratapp.ai/blog/atlassian-stride-social-with-structure/ "social with structure"), a concept initially conceived by the talented folks at Atlassian’s Stride.

\#stratapp also has a clever social/work page. This becomes your go-to page to **maximise your own productivity and responsiveness**. For example, “_in the last 72 hours, what questions have been asked, decisions or approvals made, on anything to do with strategy, risks or current projects, that I either created or assigned to others_.” That comprehensive snapshot would only take you 3-5 seconds to conclude inside #stratapp.

Not only that, the results are presented in a way you can:

* Search or drill down further, including refining the time filter to say 3, 12, 24 or 48 hours
* One click access to view the source of each match, so you can quickly understand the context
* Reply directly from this column of results, without having to open the respective sources

Under social/teams you will also notice #stratapp applies the @org-design (explained above) to automatically create teams inside #stratapp. That is, you don’t need to manually create and maintain a social group for say the Digital team within Marketing, as that is done automatically for you.

### notes & meetings

\#stratapp has built in notes, that you can add to almost anything inside #stratapp - including the strategy tree hierarchy, KPIs, risks, tasks and workboards. This helps every executive, manager and front line employee to [align day to day work to a relevant strategic context](https://stratapp.ai/blog/why-stratapp-is-10-apps-in-1/ "align day to day work to strategy").

For meetings you can add a purpose and an agenda, and you can live-edit notes with other meeting participants, whilst also interacting live with social, meeting actions, shared links and files. You can run a meeting clock, to time the overall meeting and how long you spend on each agenda item.

### tasks & workboards

You can easily collaborate on tasks and workboards inside #stratapp, including using #stratapp’s unique @org-design feature (explained above) to quickly invite members. Inside each #stratapp workboard you have the ability to filter on [social with structure](https://stratapp.ai/blog/atlassian-stride-social-with-structure/ "social with structure"), making it fast and easy for executives and others not involved day to day to quickly get up to speed on the aspects they are interested in.  We hope this feature helps to overcome [why work collaboration has remained a blind-spot for senior executives](https://stratapp.ai/blog/work-collaboration-is-still-a-blindspot-for-senior-execs/ "work collaboration blind spot").

### workspace

\#stratapp provides a workspace for employees to manage their own private tasks. The workspace automatically pulls together all tasks from across the whole of #stratapp, including the ability to filter by source type (e.g. _strategy related tasks_) and your role (e.g. _tasks I have assigned to others, that are due this week_).

## ideation

After rolling out the above five aspects of "productivity & culture", next we recommend turning on “ideation” to capture ideas and run challenges.  Challenges allow you to crowdsource ideas and contributions from your most valuable asset, the employees in your organization, as well as the external stakeholders you collaborate with (customers, partners and suppliers).

You can add an idea or challenge to almost anything inside #stratapp - including the strategy tree hierarchy, KPIs, risks, tasks and workboards.

Ideation also provides employees and managers a positive outlet to capture ideas and new thinking, whilst staying focused on their current priorities.

## strategy execution

Once you are ready for "strategy execution", we recommend starting with the “direction” page, then adding your top 3 goals to the “our plan” page.

For the “direction” page, it is worth reading [Professor Roger Martin on what CEOs should really be doing](https://stratapp.ai/professor-roger-martin-on-what-ceos-should-really-be-doing/ "Professor Roger Martin").

For the “our plan” page, it is worth applying these [two tips for communicating your business strategy](https://stratapp.ai/blog/strategic-planning-software-with-a-strategy-tree-hierarchy/ "two tips for communicating strategy").

For the “risks” page, here is the [thinking behind including risk management](https://stratapp.ai/blog/why-we-lump-our-cfos-with-risk-management/ "risk management") inside #stratapp.  Note, risk cards can be added to almost anything inside #stratapp, not only strategic items.  This makes risk management alive and interactive, transparent, org-wide and easy to cascade clear ownership.

## business performance | KPIs & OKRs

Lastly, we recommend turning on the “KPIs” page to elevate business performance through KPIs and/or OKRs.

You might need to read the next three paragraphs a few times to fully appreciate the KPI construct inside #stratapp.  That is because we have designed the whole of #stratapp with (almost) no rules, so you can easily adapt #stratapp to suit how you operate your unique business, rather than the expense, time, hassle and stress of having to adapt your business to suit #stratapp.

KPIs added to an item in the strategy tree, will show under “strategic KPIs”.

Both strategic and operational KPIs can be tagged to one or more Balanced Scorecard quadrants, as well as the properties of @org-design. This makes filtering on KPIs very powerful, for example: “_I want to see sales and marketing KPIs that belong to @G/APAC/Australia, that I am not a member of, with a status of needs attention_”.  Again, that powerful insight will only take you 3-5 seconds to conclude inside #stratapp.

You can view both strategic and operational KPIs overlaid onto the Live Org Chart, so you can quickly see who in the organization owns what KPIs.  Not only that, the parent:child hierarchy of KPIs can exist independent of the reporting lines on the Live Org Chart, meaning you can infinitely cascade KPIs to match your unique properties of @org-design.

Finally, a personal favourite!  In one click, on desktop or mobile, every employee in your organization can see their own KPIs - including status, importance and due date.
