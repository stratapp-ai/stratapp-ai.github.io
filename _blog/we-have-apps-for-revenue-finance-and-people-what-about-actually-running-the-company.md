The challenge always seems to come down to people - keeping everyone aligned, engaged and motivated in the same direction and end game.

If you think about it, there are apps for everything else (revenue, finance, people), but there has never been a simple app for actually running the company - providing clarity and context for everyone.

\#stratapp solves this and makes life easier for business owners, middle management and frontline employees.

## it is as easy as this

You (as an owner, CEO, middle manager, or frontline employee) open up your _workspace_.

You see a _task_ due Thursday "**_select workshop venue_**".

To be honest, you can't really remember where the _task_ came from, so you click on the _task_, and you can instantly see all of the collaboration on that _task_.  Nothing fancy right?  Sounds like a task app.  Nope, read on.

You see the source of the _task_, is a _meeting_.

You click on the _meeting_ link and instantly you can see the:

* purpose ("**_agree next steps for the supply chain review_**")
* agenda
* meeting notes (live for collaboration with others, and private for you)
* actions
* social conversations
* files and links

Now you remember the context of the _task_.  It makes sense.  But then you think, why were we having this _meeting_ in the first place?

You see the source of the _meeting_, is a _strategic action_ to "**_reduce supply chain costs by 25% by Dec 2021_**".  That's cool!  When you click on that, you can see all of the collaboration taking place on that _strategic action_.

You see the source of the _strategic action_, is a _strategic objective_ to "**_improve gross profit through product and supply chain innovation_**".  Easy!  When you click on that, you can see all of the collaboration taking place on that _strategic objective_.

## truly connected workspace

Imagine the power of 5, 10, 50, 500 or 50,000 employees completely aligned on the same priorities and able to see in real time exactly where their work fits into the overall strategy.

\#stratapp brings together what really matters, to create a truly connected workspace:
