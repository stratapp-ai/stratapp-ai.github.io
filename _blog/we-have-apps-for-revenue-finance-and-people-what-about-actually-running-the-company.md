The challenge comes down to people - having everyone aligned, engaged and motivated on the same end game.

If you think about it, there are apps for almost everything (CRM, service/support, finance, HR, supply chain, projects and social), but there has never been a simple app for actually running the company - providing real time clarity and context for everyone.

\#stratapp is that app. #stratapp makes life way easier for business owners/CEOs and everyone else.

## a natural flow, as easy as this

Strategy execution wins with bottom up engagement and real-time alignment, in way that flows naturally as employees collaborate on day to day work.

Let's imagine you're a team leader or mid-level manager.  You open your _workspace_ inside #stratapp.

You see a _task_ due Thursday that says "**_select workshop venue_**".

You're busy and you can't remember where that _task_ came from, so you click and see all collaboration taking place on that _task_.  Nothing fancy right?  Sounds like a task app.  Nope, read on.

You see the source of the _task_ is a _meeting_.

You click and see the _meeting_:

* purpose ("**_agree next steps for the supply chain review_**")
* agenda
* live notes
* actions
* social conversations
* files and links

... everything at your fingertips.

Now you understand the context of the _task_.  It's making sense.  But then you think, why were we having this _meeting_ in the first place?

You see the source of the _meeting_ is a _strategic action_ to "**_reduce supply chain costs_**".  It's making more sense now!  In one click, you see all collaboration taking place on that _strategic action_.

Now you're curious!  What's behind the _strategic action?_

One click and you're at the _strategic objective_ above it to "**_improve gross profit through product and supply chain innovation_**".

### consistent user experience

A beautiful thing about #stratapp is how the user experience is consistent as you move across those:

* tasks
* meetings
* strategic actions
* strategic objectives

The same consistency applies to all features inside #stratapp:

* KPIs/OKRs
* ideas
* challenges
* risks
* project workboards

### easy to implement

A consistent user experience means minimal or no end user training - and happy employees.

Not only that, you can roll out the app in phases.  Yes, that's right, you can turn different parts of the app on for individual users and/or select teams based on your unique org design.

## connected workspace

Imagine the power of 5, 10, 50, 500 or 50,000 employees aligned on the same priorities and plans, able to see in real time exactly where their day to day work fits in and the impact.

\#stratapp allows you, and everyone around you, to focus on what really matters:

### end result

You don't need to micro-manage, rely on retrospective reporting or integrate 10 different systems - the work, alignment and productivity flows naturally - in one simple app.

One simple app to run the company.
