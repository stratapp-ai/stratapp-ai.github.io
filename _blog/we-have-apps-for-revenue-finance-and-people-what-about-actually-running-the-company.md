The challenge always seems to come down to people - having everyone aligned, engaged and motivated in the same direction and on the same end game.

If you think about it, there are apps for everything else (CRM, finance, people, supply chain, service), but there has never been a simple app for actually running the company - providing real time clarity and context for everyone.

\#stratapp solves this, making life way easier for business owners/CEOs and everyone else.

## it's as easy as this

You, at any level in your organization, open your _workspace_ inside #stratapp.

You see a _task_ due Thursday that says "**_select workshop venue_**".

To be honest, you can't really remember where the _task_ came from, so you click on the _task_, and you instantly see all of the collaboration taking place on that _task_.  Nothing fancy right?  Sounds like a task app.  Nope, read on.

You see the source of the _task_, is a _meeting_.

You click on the link and instantly you can see the _meeting_:

* purpose ("**_agree next steps for the supply chain review_**")
* agenda
* meeting notes
* meeting actions
* social conversations
* files and links

... everything at your fingertips, in one place.

Now you remember the context of the _task_.  It's making sense.  But then you think, why were we having this _meeting_ in the first place?

You see the source of the _meeting_, is a _strategic action_ to "**_reduce supply chain costs by 25% by Dec 2021_**".  That's making even more sense now!  When you click on that you see all of the collaboration taking place on that _strategic action_.

Now you're curious!  What's behind the _strategic action?_  One click and your at the _strategic objective_ to "**_improve gross profit through product and supply chain innovation_**".

## a truly connected workspace

Imagine the power of 5, 10, 50, 500 or 50,000 employees aligned on the same priorities and able to see in real time exactly where their day to day work fits into the overall plans.

\#stratapp allows everyone to focus on what really matters:

Clarity and engagement is elevated at all levels of the organization and in both directions - up and down.
