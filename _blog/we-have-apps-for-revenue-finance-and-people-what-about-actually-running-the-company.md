The challenge comes down to people - having everyone aligned, engaged and motivated in the same direction and on the same end game.

If you think about it, there are apps for everything else (CRM, service/support, finance, HR, supply chain, projects and social), but there has never been a simple app for actually running the company - providing real time clarity and context for everyone.

\#stratapp is that app - making life way easier for business owners/CEOs and everyone else.

## it's as easy as this

You open your _workspace_ inside #stratapp.

You see a _task_ due Thursday that, for example, says "**_select workshop venue_**".

You're busy and you can't remember where that _task_ came from, so you click on the _task_, and you instantly see all of the collaboration taking place on that _task_.  Nothing fancy right?  Sounds like a task app.  Nope, read on.

You see the source of the _task_ is a _meeting_.

You click and see the _meeting_:

* purpose ("**_agree next steps for the supply chain review_**")
* agenda
* meeting notes
* meeting actions
* social conversations
* files and links

... everything at your fingertips.

Now you remember the context of the _task_.  It's making sense.  But then you think, why were we having this _meeting_ in the first place?

You see the source of the _meeting_ is a _strategic action_ to "**_reduce supply chain costs_**".  It's making more sense now!  In one click, you can see all of the collaboration taking place on that _strategic action_.

Now you're curious!  What's behind the _strategic action?_  One click and your at the _strategic objective,_ above that _strategic action,_ to "**_improve gross profit through product and supply chain innovation_**".

### a consistent user experience

One beautiful thing about #stratapp is that the user experience was consistent as you moved across the four aspects mentioned above: 

          task -> meeting -> strategic action -> strategic objective  

The same user experience consistency applies to the other features inside #stratapp: 

          KPIs/OKRs | ideas | challenges | risks | project workboards

### easy to implement

A consistent user experience means minimal or no end user training.  

Not only that, you can roll out the app in phases.  Yes, that's right, you can turn different parts of the app on/off for individual users and/or teams based on your org design.

## a connected workspace

Imagine the power of 5, 10, 50, 500 or 50,000 employees aligned on the same priorities and plans, able to see in real time exactly where their day to day work fits in and the impact.

\#stratapp allows you, and everyone around you, to focus on what really matters:

Clarity and engagement is elevated at all levels and in both directions - up and down.  

### the result

You don't need to micro-manage, rely on retrospective reporting or integrate 10 different systems - the work, alignment and productivity flows naturally - in 1 simple app.

1 simple app to run the company.
