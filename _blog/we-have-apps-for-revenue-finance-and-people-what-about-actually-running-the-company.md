The challenge comes down to people - having everyone aligned, engaged and motivated in the same direction and on the same end game.

If you think about it, there are apps for everything else (CRM, finance, HR, supply chain, service, projects and social), but there has never been a simple app for actually running the company - providing real time clarity and context for everyone.

\#stratapp is this, making life way easier for business owners/CEOs and everyone else.

## it's as easy as this

You open your _workspace_ inside #stratapp.

You see a _task_ due Thursday that, for example, says "**_select workshop venue_**".

You're busy and you can't remember where that _task_ came from, so you click on the _task_, and you instantly see all of the collaboration taking place on that _task_.  Nothing fancy right?  Sounds like a task app.  Nope, read on.

You see the source of the _task_, is a _meeting_.

You click that to see the _meeting_:

* purpose ("**_agree next steps for the supply chain review_**")
* agenda
* meeting notes
* meeting actions
* social conversations
* files and links

... everything at your fingertips, in one place.

Now you remember the context of the _task_.  It's making sense.  But then you think, why were we having this _meeting_ in the first place?

You see the source of the _meeting_ is a _strategic action_ to "**_reduce supply chain costs by 25% by Dec 2021_**".  It's making more sense now!  You can see all of the collaboration taking place on that _strategic action_.

Now you're curious!  What's behind the _strategic action?_  One click and your at the _strategic objective_ above that _strategic action_ to "**_improve gross profit through product and supply chain innovation_**".

### a consistent user experience

The beautiful thing about #stratapp, is that the user experience is consistent as you move across those four objects mentioned above: task -> meeting -> strategic action -> strategic  objective.  The same applies to the other rich functionality inside #stratapp: KPIs/ORKs; ideas; challenges; risks and project workboards.

### easy to implement

A consistent user experience across #stratapp means minimal to no end user training.  

Not only that, you can rollout the app in phases.  Yes, that's right, you can turn different parts of the app on/off for individual users and/or teams based on your org design.

## a truly connected workspace

Imagine the power of 5, 10, 50, 500 or 50,000 employees aligned on the same priorities and able to see in real time exactly where their day to day work fits into the overall plans.

\#stratapp allows everyone to focus on what really matters:

Clarity and engagement is elevated at all levels of the organization and in both directions - up and down.
