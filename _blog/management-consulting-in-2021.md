## learning from tier-1 firms

I nearly joined McKinsey, loved my time at Accenture and over the years I have enjoyed great experiences with folks from McKinsey, Bain, KPMG, Deloitte and EY.

Accenture's initial market leading growth to 40,000 employees was driven by _global systemisation_ and _supporting clients looking to adopt new technology_.  In the process Accenture had to learn how to take on experienced hires into manager and partner roles, as it became too slow to rely on growth from talent promoted only from within.  At the time this was a significant pivot, not without several hiccups.  Then came the difficult split from Arthur Andersen, rebranding Andersen Consulting to Accenture, and the global expectation for consultants to know more about the industries they are advising; hence a matrix org design of market verticals and skills-based horizontals.

It took xx years for Accenture to grow to 40,000 employees and only the next xx years to grow past 400,000 employees.  Accenture now employees xxx,xxx, with xxx in revenue and a market cap of $xxxbillion.  Whilst Accenture has continued to go deep on tech, the incredible growth has come from partnering with clients on operations.  Rather than only pursue one-off projects consulting on improving operations, Accenture pitched themselves to run part of the client's business.  Although the market refers to this as outsourcing or BPO, the commercial relationship is more sophisticated and founded on:

* Accenture applying world's best practice to improve the client's outcomes
* Sharing in the commercial risks, investments (time, money and/or resources) and upsides
* Long term deals that embrace a collaborative mindset as business partners

Although these deals have more expensive sales cycles and lower margins than consulting, 4 strategic advantages have emerged for Accenture:

1. One deal leads to more deals per client (e.g. start by running part of the finance function, and end up running all of finance, ITC, call centres and supply chain operations, freeing the client to focus on strategy, marketing, R&D and customer experience)
2. Most deals lead to to more consulting projects, that were non-competitive 
3. Deep technology and process insights for a sector in one country, helps more deals to be won globally in that sector
4. Proven stars from running operations on one deal become an incredibly valuable source of talent for winning, running and improving other deals

Looking ahead to 2021, I believe tier-2 and niche consulting firms of 200 to 20,000 employees, can apply some of these insights to planning their own growth.

## growth opportunity #1 - SaaS technologies

SaaS is an abbreviation for _software as a service_, usually priced per user or on usage.  SaaS is elegantly described by xxxxx as "xxx balance / compromisexxxx."

There are a few different approaches to choosing which tech.  I'm a fan of these two:

### 1 - pick trending tech that is _easy to learn_ and will _generate consulting work_

Aside from outsourcing and industry restructures, there is no better source for driving consulting revenue than assisting clients on their journey to adopt and evolve new technology.  That fuelled the first phase of Accenture's market leading growth.

Clients are time poor, and today's real-time management culture is making this even worse.  Client's need help to successfully adopt and evolve new technology, and the consulting opportunities are perhaps broader than what you might think:

If I was a tier-2 or niche consultancy of 200 to 20,000 employees, these would be my top 3 picks

### 2 - pick _industry specific tech_ that is hard to learn

## growth opportunity #2 - distributed working

COVID-19 has brought to the mainstream what marketing, tech and product teams have known for 10 years: you can trust people to work remotely and collaboration tech is way better than email.

## growth opportunity #3 - niche operations

Rather than go after large-scale price-driven outsourcing, look for opportunities that allow you to niche around what you can do better than other providers (and of course the client doing it themselves internally).

Think about the 4 strategic advantages (listed above) that emerged for Accenture.  Even if you only place 3x FTEs into a client fulfilling a niche operational role, you can then offer that service globally to achieve scale.
