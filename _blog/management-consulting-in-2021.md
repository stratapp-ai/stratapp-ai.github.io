## learning from tier-1 firms

I nearly joined McKinsey, loved my time at Accenture and over the years I have enjoyed great experiences with folks from McKinsey, Bain, KPMG, Deloitte and EY.

Accenture's initial market leading growth to 40,000 employees was driven by _global systemisation_ and _supporting clients looking to adopt new technology_.  In the process Accenture had to learn how to take on experienced hires into manager and partner roles, as it became too slow to rely on growth from talent promoted only from within.  At the time this was a significant pivot, not without several hiccups.  Then came the difficult split from Arthur Andersen, rebranding Andersen Consulting to Accenture, and the global expectation for consultants to know more about the industries they are advising; hence a matrix org design of market verticals and skills-based horizontals.

It took xx years to grow to 40,000 employees and only the next xx years to grow past 400,000 employees.  Accenture now employees xxx,xxx, with xxx in revenue and a market cap of $xxxbillion.  Whilst Accenture has continued to go deep on tech, the incredible growth has come from partnering with clients on operations.  Rather than do one-off projects consulting on improving operations, Accenture pitched themselves to run part of the client's business.  Although typically referred to as outsourcing or BPO, the commercial relationship is more sophisticated and founded on:

* Accenture applying world's best practice to improve the client's outcomes
* Sharing in the commercial risks, investments (time, money and/or resources) and upsides
* Long term deals that embrace a collaborative mindset as business partners

Although these deals have longer more expensive sales cycles and lower margins than consulting, 4 strategic advantages have emerged for Accenture:

1. One deal leads to more deals per client (e.g. start by running part of the finance function, and end up running all of finance, IT, call centre and supply chain operations, freeing the client to focus on strategy, marketing, R&D and customer experience)
2. Most deals lead to to more consulting projects, that were non-competitive 
3. Deep technology and process insights for a sector in one country, helps more deals to be won globally in that sector
4. Proven stars from running operations on one deal become an incredibly valuable source of talent for winning, running and improving other deals

Looking ahead to 2021, I believe tier-2 and niche consulting firms of 200 to 20,000 employees, can apply some of these insights to planning their own growth.
