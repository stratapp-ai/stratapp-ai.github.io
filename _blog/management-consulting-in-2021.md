## learning from tier-1 firms

I nearly joined McKinsey, loved my time at Accenture and over the years I have enjoyed great experiences with folks from McKinsey, Bain, BCG, KPMG, Deloitte and EY.

There are many great consulting firms in each country.  This article focuses on what the tier-2 and niche firms of say 200 to 20,000 employees, can learn from the tier-1s.

Accenture's initial market leading growth to 40,000 employees was driven by two focuses: _global systemisation of every aspect of the business_ and _supporting clients looking to adopt new technology_.  In the process Accenture had to learn how to assimilate experienced hires into manager and partner roles, as it became too slow to grow on talent promoted only from within.  At the time, circa 1995-6, this was a significant culture pivot, not without several hiccups.  Then came the difficult split from Arthur Andersen in 199x, rebranding Andersen Consulting to Accenture, whilst responding to a global market expectation for consultants to know more about the industries they are advising - rather than charging premium fees to learn on the job.  For most tier-1 firms this gave birth to a matrix org design of market verticals and skills-based horizontals, the speed and scope of execution at Accenture was breath-taking.

That said, it took xx years for Accenture to grow to 40,000 employees in 199x, making it the largest tier-1 firm in the world, nearly double the size of second place PriceWaterhouseCoopers.  That was just the beginning.  In the next xx years the firm grew rapidly to 400,000 employees.  Accenture now employees xxx,xxx, with xxx in revenue and a market cap of $xxxbillion.  Whilst Accenture has continued to support clients on adopting new tech, their incredible growth came mostly from partnering with clients on operations. 

That is, rather than only pursuing one-off consulting projects on improving the client's business, Accenture pitched to run part of the client's operations.  Enter, recurring revenue.  Although the market refers to this as outsourcing or BPO, Accenture's approach to the client relationship was more sophisticated and founded on:

* Accenture continuing to apply world's best practice to improve the client's outcomes
* Sharing the commercial risks, investments (time, money and/or resources) and upsides
* Long term deals and org design that embraces a collaborative mindset as business partners

Although these deals have more expensive sales cycles and lower margins than consulting, 4 strategic advantages emerged for Accenture:

1. One deal leads to more deals per client (e.g. start by running part of the finance function, and end up running all of finance, ITC, call centres and supply chain operations, freeing the client to focus on strategy, marketing, R&D and customer experience)
2. Most deals lead to to more consulting projects, that were non-competitive 
3. Deep technology and process insights for a sector in one country, helps more deals to be won globally in that sector
4. Proven stars from running operations on one deal become an incredibly valuable source of talent for winning, running and improving other deals

Looking ahead to 2021, I believe tier-2 and niche consulting firms of 200 to 20,000 employees, can apply some of these insights to planning growth.

## growth opportunity #1 - SaaS technologies

SaaS, meaning _software as a service_, is usually priced per user or on usage.  SaaS is elegantly described by xxxxx as "xxx balance / compromisexxxx."

Supporting clients on SaaS represents an outstanding growth opportunity for tier-2 and niche consulting firms.  

There are a few different approaches to choosing which tech a consulting firm should embrace.  I'm a fan of these two:

### 1 - pick sector-agnostic tech that is easy to learn and will generate high-value consulting work

Aside from outsourcing and industry restructures, there is no better way to drive consulting revenue than assisting clients on their journey to _adopt and evolve new technology_.  That strategy fuelled the first phase of Accenture's market leading growth.

Clients are increasingly time poor and unable to focus on getting real work done.  Leaders at all levels seem consumed within cultures of real-time messaging and 247 availability.

Therefore, client need help to successfully adopt and evolve new technology, they are willing to pay for it to de-risk implementations and the consulting opportunities are perhaps broader than what you might think:

* high level planning / context validation
* change management & communications
* project management
* requirements gathering / as-is & to-be mapping
* setting up the tech
* onboarding the first phase of users
* supporting those users
* building a show case of successes and learnings
* building the capabilities to scale rollouts
* managing rollouts progressively
* measuring and learning from outcomes

If I was a tier-2 or niche consultancy of 200 to 20,000 employees, below would be my top 3 SaaS technology picks to build a consulting services offering around:

#### strategy execution

There is only one app that solves [the leadership cycle](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/the-leadership-cycle/ "the leadership cycle") in one digital workspace: [https://stratappsaas.com/](https://stratappsaas.com/ "https://stratappsaas.com/").

The consulting opportunities are brilliant, including upselling other services: [https://bit.ly/stratapp-consulting-partners-win-win-win](https://bit.ly/stratapp-consulting-partners-win-win-win "consulting win win win").

#### employee engagement

As well as supporting mainstream HCM rollouts (e.g. [Workday](https://www.workday.com/ "Workday")), you could look to support emerging tech in employee engagement and culture building, such as:

* [Culture Amp](https://www.cultureamp.com/ "Culture Amp")
* [15Five](https://www.15five.com/ "15Five")

#### CRM

When you look under the bonnet, the top three CRMs ([Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/ "Salesforce"), [Dynamics](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft Dynamics") and [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com "Zoho CRM")) are remarkedly similar.  Clients hire CRM implementation firms that usually have deep skills in only one of those three.  Those implementation firms are often very weak at the broader thinking and validation that the client needs for their CRM implementation to be successful.  As a result, most CRM implementations are considered a failure by clients.

The CRM implementation firms doing this work are usually lacking more broader consulting skills like:

* business strategy
* business and operating model design
* process mapping, design and activity-based-costing
* org design
* risks and mitigations
* thinking through how the above may change next 3-5 years
* change management
* training planning and delivery

Configuring and programming the CRM has become a commodity service that you can offshore, or price compete onshore, providing you tightly manage the concept design and functional specs.  Unfortunately clients continue to pay huge onshore implementation $/day for this work, and most CRM implementations fail because those firms don't have the broader consulting skills listed above.

You can join the dots on where to take this opportunity.

### 2 - pick industry or function specific tech that is easy to learn and will generate ongoing consulting

There are almost unlimited opportunities here, so your criteria may come down to what interests you and how quickly the market is growing.

Here are a few function examples to help get you started:

* Travel management (e.g. [Concur](https://www.concur.com "Concur"))
* Spend management (e.g. [Coupa](https://www.coupa.com/ "Coupa"))
* Rostering (e.g. [Deputy](https://www.deputy.com/ "Deputy"))
* Asset management (e.g. xxxx)
* Quality (e.g. xxxx)
* ERP/supply chain (e.g. xxxx)

## growth opportunity #2 - distributed working

COVID-19 has brought to the mainstream what marketing, tech and product teams have known for about 10 years: _you can trust people to work remotely and collaboration tech is way better than email._

_Remote working_ implies you have an office to be remote from.  We've already seen announcements from dozens of household brands saying they will now allow most, if not all employees, to work from home.  Those companies that are keeping an office will need to think through a whole range of factors that can be helped by consultants:

* office design for frequent or infrequent visits by home-based workers
* team building and leadership
* technology for strategy, execution and collaboration (e.g. [#stratapp](https://stratappsaas.com/ "#stratapp"))
* hiring, induction, performance management, offboarding and alumni
* security and OH&S

_Distributed working_ has no office at all.  Nothing to be remote from.  Matt Mullenweg, the founder of Wordpress.com, employs 1,200 people across 75 countries without an office.  Matt articulates 5 levels of autonomy in his podcast with Sam Harris on [The New Future of Work](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/The-New-Future-of-Work-a-Sam-Harris-podcast-interview-with-Matt-Mullenweg-on-distributed-working/ "The New Future of Work").  Helping clients on their journey to distributed working is potentially a consulting goldmine.

## growth opportunity #3 - niche operations

Rather than go after large-scale price-driven outsourcing deals, you could look for opportunities that allow you to niche on what you can do better than other providers (and of course the client doing it themselves internally).

Think about the 4 strategic advantages above that emerged for Accenture.  Even if you only place 3x FTEs into a client delivering on a niche part of their business operations, you can then offer that service globally to other clients, thereby achieving scale and ROI.
