## learning from tier-1 firms

I nearly joined McKinsey, loved my time at Accenture and over the years I have enjoyed great experiences with folks from KPMG, Deloitte and EY.

Accenture's marketing leading growth to 40,000 employees was driven by global systemisation and supporting clients looking to adopt new technology.  In the process Accenture learnt how to take on experienced hires into manager and partner roles, as it became too slow to rely on what had worked so well for xx years - developing and promoting talent hired straight from university. 

It took xx years to grow to 40,000 employees and only xx years to grow past 400,000 by 20xx.  Whilst Accenture has continued to go deep on tech, the incredible growth has come from partnering with clients on operations.  Rather than do one-off projects consulting on how to improve an operation, Accenture pitched themselves as the client's partner to run part of the client's business.  The commercial relationship is typically founded on:

* Accenture applying world's best practice to improve the client's outcomes
* Sharing in the commercial risks, investments and upsides
* Long term deals that embrace a mindset of business partners

Although these deals had longer sales cycles and lower margins, three advantages emerged for Accenture:

1. One deal leads to more deals per client (e.g. start by running part of the finance function, and end up running all of finance, IT, call centre and supply chain operations, freeing the client to focus on strategy, marketing, R&D and customer experience)
2. Most deals lead to to more consulting projects, that were non-competitive 
3. Deep technology and process insights for a sector in one country, helps more deals to be won globally in that sector
4. Proven stars from running operations on one deal become an incredibly valuable source of talent for winning, running and improving other deals

Tier-2 and niche consulting firms, of 200 to 20,000 employees, can apply some of these recent history insights to planning their own growth opportunities in 2021.
