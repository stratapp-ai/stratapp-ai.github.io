## learning from Accenture

I nearly joined McKinsey, loved my time at Accenture and over the years I have enjoyed inspiring experiences with folks from McKinsey, Bain, BCG, KPMG, Deloitte and EY.

This is my personal inside take on how Accenture has achieved outstanding growth these last 30 years - the undisputed market leader every one of those years - and how tier-2 and niche firms of 200 to 20,000 employees can apply these insights to grow revenue in 2021.

### Accenture's early growth

Accenture's initial market leading growth to 33,000 employees by 1995 was driven by two focuses: _global systemisation of every aspect of the business_ and _supporting clients looking to adopt new technology_.  To sustain that growth rate, Accenture learnt how to assimilate experienced hires into manager and partner roles (fortunate for me), as it was going to be too slow to only promote talent from within.  This was a significant culture pivot that presented several new challenges.  Then in 1997 came the difficult split from Arthur Andersen, resolved via arbitration in 2000 and rebranding from Andersen Consulting to Accenture (a name chosen by crowdsourcing ideas from employees, with the winner a Norwegian employee, Kim Petersen, who conceived Accenture from "accent on the future").  At this time the firm responded rapidly to a global market expectation for consultants (and investment bankers) to know more about the industries they are advising - rather than charging premium fees to learn on the job.  For most tier-1 firms this gave birth to a matrix org design of market verticals and skills-based horizontals.  

The speed, scope and thoroughness of execution at Accenture was breath-taking.  I learnt heaps, but that was just the beginning.

### Accenture's rapid growth

From the year 2,000, it only took the firm 15 years to grow to 358,000 employees and US$31bn revenue; now \~500k employees and $50bn revenue.  Whilst Accenture has continued to support clients on adopting new tech, their 10-fold growth has come mostly from partnering with clients on operations.

That is, rather than only pursuing one-off consulting projects on improving the client's business, from the mid-90s Accenture pitched to run part of the client's business.  Enter, recurring revenue.  Although widely referred to as Business Process Management, Accenture's approach to the client relationship was sophisticated and founded on:

* Accenture continuing to apply world's best practice to improve the client's outcomes, often against a comprehensive baseline that was agreed with the client upfront
* Sharing the commercial risks, investments (time, money and/or resources) and upsides
* Long term deals that embrace a collaborative mindset as business partners

### Accenture's strategic advantages

Although these deals have more expensive sales cycles and lower margins than consulting, 4 strategic advantages have emerged for Accenture:

1. One deal leads to more deals per client (e.g. start by running part of the finance function, and end up running all of finance, ITC, call centres and supply chain operations, freeing the client to focus on strategy, marketing, R&D and customer experience)
2. Most deals lead to to more consulting projects, that were non-competitive
3. Deep technology and process insights for a sector in one country, helps more deals to be won globally in that sector
4. Proven stars from running operations on one deal become an incredibly valuable source of talent for winning, running and improving other deals

I believe most tier-2 and niche consulting firms of 200 to 20,000 employees can apply some of these insights to proactively create new opportunities for growth in 2021.

## 2021 growth opportunity #1 - SaaS technologies

SaaS, meaning _software as a service_, is a way of delivering applications over the internet.  Customers don't have to buy/install/maintain/update hardware or software themselves.  All they need is an internet connection.

Tier-2 and niche consulting firms often underestimate the revenue potential of supporting clients on how they choose, adopt, use and evolve SaaS.  Not to mention the almost unlimited consulting revenue potential from having a closer client relationship and understanding, as a result of doing this work.  I think the latter is a key criteria for figuring out which SaaS technologies to align with.

### pick sector-agnostic tech that is easy to learn and will generate high-value consulting

Aside from outsourcing and industry restructures, there is no better way to drive consulting revenue than assisting clients on their journey to _adopt and evolve new technology_.  That strategy fuelled the first phase of Accenture's market leading growth.

Clients are increasingly time poor and unable to focus on getting real work done.  Leaders at all levels seem consumed within cultures of real-time messaging and 247 availability.

Therefore, client need help to successfully adopt and evolve new technology, they are willing to pay for it to de-risk implementations and the consulting opportunities are perhaps broader than what you might think:

* high level planning / context validation
* change management & communications
* project management
* requirements gathering / as-is & to-be mapping
* setting up the tech
* onboarding the first phase of users
* supporting those users
* building a show case of successes and learnings
* building the capabilities to scale rollouts
* managing rollouts progressively
* measuring and learning from outcomes

If I was a tier-2 or niche consultancy of 200 to 20,000 employees, below would be my top 3 SaaS technology picks to build a consulting services offering around:

#### SaaS for leading a company | strategy to execution

There is only one app that solves [the leadership cycle](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/the-leadership-cycle/ "the leadership cycle") in one digital workspace: [https://stratappsaas.com/](https://stratappsaas.com/ "https://stratappsaas.com/").

Whilst easy to learn, the product lends itself naturally to driving consulting revenue on both implementations and upselling additional consulting based on real-time insights on what is happening client side.  Thereby [creating a win:win:win](https://bit.ly/stratapp-consulting-partners-win-win-win  "creating a win:win:win") for the client, consultant and #stratapp.

#### SaaS for employee engagement

As well as supporting mainstream HCM rollouts (e.g. [Workday](https://www.workday.com/ "Workday")), you could look to support emerging tech in employee engagement and culture building, such as:

* [Culture Amp](https://www.cultureamp.com/ "Culture Amp")
* [15Five](https://www.15five.com/ "15Five")

#### SaaS CRM - mature services market with a blindspot for SMB sector

When you look under the bonnet, the top three CRMs ([Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/ "Salesforce"), [Dynamics](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft Dynamics") and [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com "Zoho CRM")) are remarkedly similar.  Clients hire CRM implementation firms that usually have deep skills in only one of those three.  Those implementation firms are often very weak at the broader thinking and validation that the client needs for their CRM implementation to be successful.  As a result, most CRM implementations are considered a failure by clients.

The CRM implementation firms doing this work are usually lacking more broader consulting skills like:

* business strategy
* business and operating model design
* process mapping, design and activity-based-costing
* org design
* risks and mitigations
* thinking through how the above may change next 3-5 years
* change management
* training planning and delivery

Configuring and programming the CRM has become a commodity service that you can offshore, or price compete onshore, providing you tightly manage the concept design and functional specs.  Unfortunately clients continue to pay huge onshore implementation $/day for this work, and most CRM implementations fail because those firms don't have the broader consulting skills listed above.

You can join the dots on where to take this opportunity.

### pick industry or function specific tech that is easy to learn and will generate ongoing consulting

There are unlimited opportunities here, so your criteria may come down to what interests your firm and local market potential.

Here are a few _function specific tech_ examples to help get you started:

* Travel management (e.g. [Concur](https://www.concur.com "Concur"))
* Spend management (e.g. [Coupa](https://www.coupa.com/ "Coupa"))
* Rostering (e.g. [Deputy](https://www.deputy.com/ "Deputy"))
* Safety (e.g. [SafetyCulture](https://safetyculture.com/ "Safety Culture"))

_Industry specific tech_ is fast emerging in healthcare (including medical practices and pharmacy), aged care, fleet management, aviation, hospitality and retail.

## 2021 growth opportunity #2 - distributed working

COVID-19 has brought to the mainstream what marketing, tech and product teams have known for about 10 years: _you can trust most people to work remotely and collaboration tech is way better than email._

_Remote and hybrid working_ implies you have an office to be remote from.  We've already seen announcements from dozens of household brands saying they will now allow most, if not all employees, to work from home.  Those companies that are keeping an office will need to think through a whole range of factors, that can be helped by consultants:

* office design and ergonomics for frequent or infrequent visits by home-based workers
* team building, creativity and leadership
* technology that allows you to lead a company from anywhere (e.g. [#stratapp](https://stratappsaas.com/ "#stratapp"))
* balancing strategy and day to day execution
* hiring, induction, performance management, offboarding and alumni
* security and OH&S

_Distributed working_ refers to no office at all.  Nothing to be remote from.

Matt Mullenweg, the founder of Wordpress.com, employs 1,200 people across 75 countries without an office.  Matt articulates 5 levels of autonomy in this brilliant interview with Sam Harris on [The New Future of Work](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/The-New-Future-of-Work-a-Sam-Harris-podcast-interview-with-Matt-Mullenweg-on-distributed-working/ "The New Future of Work").

Helping clients on their journey to remote, hybrid and distributed working is potentially a consulting goldmine.

## 2021 growth opportunity #3 - niche operations

Rather than go after large-scale price-driven outsourcing deals, you could look for opportunities that allow you to niche on what you can do better than other providers, and of course the client doing it themselves internally.

Think about the 4 strategic advantages above that emerged for Accenture.  Even if you only place two or three people into a client delivering on a niche part of their operations, you can then offer that service globally to other clients, thereby achieving scale and ROI.  Along the way you'll pick up more non-competitive consulting work and new operations deals.
