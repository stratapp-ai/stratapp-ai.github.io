I nearly joined McKinsey, loved my time at Accenture and over the years I have enjoyed great experiences with folks from KPMG, Deloitte and EY.

Accenture's marketing leading growth to 40,000 employees was driven by global systemisation and supporting clients looking to adopt new technology.  In the process Accenture learnt how to take on experienced hires into manager and partner roles, as it became too slow to rely on what had worked so well for xx years - developing and promoting talent hired straight from university. 

It took xx years to grow to 40,000 employees and only xx years to grow past 400,000 by 20xx.
