**_“_**_Marten, we currently use Jira, Confluence, Xero, Salesforce, Harvest, Google Docs and Slack, and I still have no idea what’s happening in my business.”_

Exactly!

I feel like I cannot say this enough: the proliferation of niche technology along with legacy ERP, CRM and HCM technology has created an environment of unnecessary complexity. This impacts every element of our business and most importantly our people.

Every company I’ve been involved with typically enabled systems that were in the best interest of the company, not always their employees. We forced a series of fragmented tools on our teams that required manual entry and, in some cases, double handling – so the company could get the answer it craved.

As a young senior leader launching new markets across Asia-Pacific, it dawned on me that I was doing the same things. As a result making the job unnecessarily harder for my teams.

## **our teams and global leaders are talking**

And clearly it’s on other’s radars. Recently on LinkedIn there was an interesting post on the CRM landscape being a dumping ground for information. Meaning it became a forced mechanism for employees to enter data (typically late and isolated from the wider group) so the company can get some level of data and top down accountability.

Another post was about ‘how they had to touch 5 apps to deliver on one simple task’. The thousands of responses empathised and echoed their frustrations.

The burning question hammering away became: how do I enable my teams for success? For me, the answer was clear – create a simple and connected workspace.

## **creating a simple and connected workspace requires a new way of thinking**

But how? We need to start from the ground and work up, not the top down business models we have built over the generations. We need to think about the tools our people need to plan, align, prioritise, execute and collaborate. I believe this framework will empower teams to take ownership of their workspace like never before.

We need to give them a single space to work, in one simple to use app. I believe it will have an org-wide impact on culture and performance. This is not a new way of working, it’s a new way of thinking at all levels.

It amazes me when you think about it – we come to work to create, align, prioritise, communicate and execute the plan. But the more founders, CEOs, executives and teams I speak with, it appears that procuring a tool that can achieve all this, while delivering a personalised and delightful experience at all levels, is not among their top five tech acquisitions in 2020!

Why?
