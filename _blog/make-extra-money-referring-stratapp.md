\#stratapp is sector, geography, culture and size agnostic.

\#stratapp suits most organizations, from 5 to 500,000 employees.

You can refer #stratapp into any level of a potential client - a team member, team leader, manager, senior manager, executive or business owner.

It does not have to be a CxO role or business owner, even though these roles have the most influence and will join the dots on the competitive advantage and business valuation potential of #stratapp.

## what is the referral model?

We offer 2 types:

1. **referral partner** (which can be anyone, including employees of clients) - 10% of SaaS fees, for the first 18 months on clients they referrer
2. **business partner** (by invitation) - 10% of SaaS fees for life, plus 10% for life from the clients of business partners they introduce

We are also working on an **equity partner** model, which you can read about [here](http://bit.ly/make-money-referring-stratapp "make money referring #stratapp").

## what is the referral process?

We keep it simple:

1. **register** the potential client - by emailing sales@stratapp.ai, so we first check that client does not yet already belong to another reffer
2. **introduce** the potential client
3. **receive** % of SaaS fees - quarterly, when the client reaches 20 or more paid users
