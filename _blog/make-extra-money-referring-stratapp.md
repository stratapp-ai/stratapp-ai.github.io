## what is the referral model?

We offer two types:

* **referral partner** (which can be anyone, including the end users of existing clients) - 10% of SaaS fees, for the first 18 months on clients they referrer
* **business partner** (by invitation) - 10% of SaaS fees for life, plus 10% for life from the clients of business partners they introduce

We are also working on an **equity partner** model, which you can read about [here](http://bit.ly/make-money-referring-stratapp "make money referring #stratapp").

## what is the referral process?

We keep it simple:

1. **register** the potential client - by emailing sales@stratapp.ai, so we first check that client does not yet already belong to another reffer
2. **introduce** the potential client
3. **receive** % of SaaS fees - quarterly, when the client reaches 20 or more paid users
