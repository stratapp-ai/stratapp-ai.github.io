## why should I refer #stratapp?

There are 3 reasons to refer #stratapp:

1. add value to others
2. make money
3. gain an edge

$US40,000 in referral fees equates to only 5 clients of 1,200 users each.

That's not many, when you think about how many people you know.

We have one referrer in Virginia USA who, in the last month, has introduced 14x potential clients ranging from 20 to 60,000 employees, and totalling over 500,000 employees.

## who are the ideal clients?

\#stratapp is sector, geography, culture and size agnostic.

\#stratapp suits most organizations, from 5 to 500,000 employees.

You can refer #stratapp into any level of a potential client - team member, team leader, manager, senior manager, executive or business owner.

It does not have to be a CxO role or business owner, although these roles have the most influence and will join the dots on the competitive advantage and business valuation potential of #stratapp.

## what is the referral model?

We offer 2 types:

1. **referral partner** (which can be anyone, including employees of clients) - 10% of SaaS fees for the first 18 months on clients they referrer
2. **business partner** (by invitation) - 10% of SaaS fees for life, plus 10% for life from the clients of other business partners they introduce

We are also working on an **equity partner** model, which you can read about [here](http://bit.ly/make-money-referring-stratapp "make money referring #stratapp").

## what is the referral process?

We keep it simple:

1. **register** the potential client - by emailing sales@stratapp.ai, so we can first check the potential client does not already belong to another referrer
2. **introduce** the potential client
3. **receive** % of SaaS fees - paid to you quarterly, when the client reaches 20 or more paid users
