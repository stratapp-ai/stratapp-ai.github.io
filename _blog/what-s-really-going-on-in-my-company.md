Year on year I see daily priorities pulling our time and focus away from achieving our strategic goals.

I keep reflecting on [Covey’s four quadrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People") and how he uniquely described the challenge of balancing urgent vs what's really important.

I am the CEO. I have 8 direct reports and 1,400 employees spread across 6 locations.

I know that tinkering at the edges won’t work. I have decided to fundamentally rethink how I run this company.

## no more offsite annual planning

First, I’m going to stop doing the big offsite annual planning workshops, which in the end only motivate a subset of those whom were able to attend. Every year we come away from those strategy offsites with a slide deck that most folks subsequently ignore or don’t understand.

Instead, this year I am going to make strategy and execution alive and interactive. I want us to constantly apply what we are learning each week, rather than view strategy as an annual exercise or a static document. 

To achieve this, I am going to give every employee #stratapp, the world’s first org-wide strategy execution app.

## reduce our 22 IT systems down to 5

Next, I am going to reduce our 22 different IT systems down to only 5:

1. #stratapp - for both strategic and day to day work
2. CRM+desk - for customer relationships and support
3. Finance - for compliance and operations
4. HR - for compliance and operations
5. Comms - for email and document sharing

Apart from the social media platforms we use for lead generation and referral sales, these 5 systems will be it.

## everyone working in the same space

We lose so much time having people working in disparate systems, including a bunch of different apps for social, tasks, projects, meetings and note taking. Quite often several of us are sitting in meetings and writing down our own subjective interpretation of the notes and actions, in different formats and places. #stratapp has live notes, including a timed meeting agenda and one click access to the meeting context, social, tasks, files and links.

I have totally lost patience with IT integrations - trying to get a dozen different systems to talk to each other and constantly chasing our tail each year on upgrades and maintenance.

\#stratapp is [10 apps in 1](https://stratapp.ai/blog/stratapp-explainer-video/ "10 apps in 1"), so we will use #stratapp to seamlessly align every employee on both strategic and daily work:

## 3 new operating principles

Finally, I am going to introduce 3 new operating principles:

1. **No internal email** - all internal comms will be inside #stratapp, using their [social with structure](https://stratapp.ai/blog/atlassian-stride-social-with-structure/ "social with structure"). Eliminating internal email will reduce emails from 200 to about 20 per person per day. It will also make checking and replying to emails way more interesting and actually adding value.  Why?  Because all emails hitting our inbox will only be external - from customers, partners and suppliers.
2. **Transparency** - we will encourage staff to apply the default restricted security setting in #stratapp, thereby making work collaboration transparent. [Ray Dalio](https://stratapp.ai/principles-by-ray-dalio-embracing-radical-transparency/ "Ray Dalio") has proven that org-wide transparency elevates individual, team, manager, executive and overall company performance.
3. **Alignment** - we will make sure that every task, initiative, idea, risk or note we are working on, has a direct or indirect link to our strategic goals/objectives/actions/projects. [Aligning day to day work to strategy](https://stratapp.ai/blog/why-stratapp-is-10-apps-in-1/ "aligning day to day work to strategy") is easy to do inside #stratapp.

Like I said, I'm done with tinkering at the edges.  It is time for us to rethink how we run this company - for the benefit of all levels, roles and generations, not to mention our customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders.
