Year on year I see daily priorities pulling our time and focus away from achieving our strategic goals. 

I keep reflecting on [Covey’s four quadrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People") and the challenge of balancing time and resources between urgent versus important.

I am the CEO. I have 8 direct reports and 1,400 employees spread across 6 locations.

I know that tinkering at the edges won’t work. I have decided to fundamentally rethink how I run this company.

## No More Annual Planning

First, I’m going to stop doing the big offsite “annual planning” workshops, which in the end only motivate a subset of those lucky enough to attend. Every year we come away with a slide deck that most folks subsequently ignore or don’t understand.

Instead, this year I am going to make strategy and execution alive and interactive. I want us to constantly apply what we are learning each week, rather than view strategy as a static document. To do that I am going to give everyone #stratapp, the world’s first org-wide every-employee strategy execution app.

## Reduce 22 IT systems down to 5

Next, I am going to reduce our 22 different IT systems down to only 5:

1. #stratapp - for strategic direction, our plan and day to day social and work collaboration
2. CRM+desk - for managing our customer relationships and support
3. Finance
4. HR - for compliance and administration
5. Comms - for email and document sharing

Apart from the social media platforms we use for lead generation and referral sales, these 5 systems will be it.

## Everyone in the same space

We lose so much time having people working in disparate systems, including a bunch of different apps for tasks, projects, meetings and note taking. Quite often several of us are sitting in meetings writing down our own version of the actions in all different formats and places. #stratapp has live notes built into the app, including a timed meeting agenda and one click to access the meeting context, social, tasks, files and links.

I have totally lost patience with IT integrations - trying to get a dozen different systems to talk to each other and constantly chasing our tail each year on upgrades and maintenance.

\#stratapp is 10 apps in 1, so we will use that to seamlessly align every employee on both strategic and daily work:

## 3 new operating principles

Finally, I am going to introduce 3 new operating principles:

1. **No internal email** - all internal comms will be inside #stratapp, using their [social with structure](https://stratapp.ai/blog/atlassian-stride-social-with-structure/ "social with structure"). Eliminating internal email will reduce emails from 200 to about 20 per day. It will also make checking and replying to emails way more interesting and actually adding value.  Why?  Because all emails will only be from customers, partners and suppliers.
2. **Transparency** - we will encourage staff to apply the default “restricted” security setting in #stratapp, thereby making work collaboration transparent. [Ray Dalio ](https://stratapp.ai/blog/radical-transparency/ "Ray Dalio | radical transparency")has proven that transparency elevates performance.
3. **Alignment** - we will make sure that every task, initiative, idea, risk or note we are working on, has a direct or indirect link to our strategic goals/objectives/actions/projects. Aligning day to day work to strategy is easy to do inside #stratapp.
