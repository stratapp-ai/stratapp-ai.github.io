At #stratapp, we started to think about **how to engage 100% of employees**, rather than only those folks who are lucky enough to be inside the strat-dev circle.

Why? The historical challenge for business owners, CEOs and management consultants has not been a lack of ideas or the process of strategy development.

The challenge is strategy execution. To put it bluntly, strategy execution rarely meets expectations, as brilliantly articulated by Richard Rumelt in [Good Strategy Bad Strategy](https://stratapp.ai/good-strategy-bad-strategy-by-richard-rumelt/ "Good Strategy Bad Strategy").

Here’s how #stratapp helps make strategy execution consistently exceed expectations:

1. **Org-Wide** - designed and [priced](https://stratapp.ai/pricing/ "#stratapp pricing") from the outset as an org-wide every-employee user experience
2. **Intuitive** - easy to use for all levels, roles and generations - applying what you already know
3. **Context** - innovating further on existing social and work collaboration apps, then adding the most important ingredient - the _strategic context_ of why the organization exists and what it is trying to achieve
4. **Daily** - adding value to every employee daily, supporting them on both daily and strategic work - thereby making sure the strategic context and goals/objectives/actions/projects remain front of mind
5. **Radical** - helping business owners and CEOs actually achieve [Ray Dalio’s radical transparency](https://stratapp.ai/blog/radical-transparency/ "Radical Transparency from Ray Dalio")

To learn more about solving strategy execution, here is a [90 second explainer video](https://stratapp.ai/blog/stratapp-explainer-video/ "#stratapp explainer video").

We hope you become a passionate advocate of #stratapp, the strategy execution app that even [millennials](https://stratapp.ai/blog/millennials/ "Millennials vs Y Gen") love.
