## OKR don't #1

**Don't start with OKRs.**

Start with the strategy tree and your leadership team.

## OKR don't #2

**Don't stop evolving strategy** whilst executing your monthly/quarterly OKRs.

Strategy never stops.  Your strategy tree should be:

* live and interactive
* cascading to execution
* guided by your vision, why and direction

NB - all 6 are easy modules inside #stratapp

## OKR don't #3

**Don't say to employees: "We are rolling out OKRs!"**

OKRs are only one piece of a bigger puzzle.

Try this instead: _the leadership team have recently been working in one digital workspace for ideation + strategy + execution + collaboration, and now we want to progressively open that up to the whole company, so we can evolve ideas, planning, strategy formation and strategy execution together_

## OKR don't #4

**Don't confuse OKRs with KPIs.**

OKRs = one-off lifetime and only 2 to 4 per quarter for every 500 employees

KPIs = ongoing lifetime and you may have 15 to 150 indicators worth tracking

When you see KPIs going off track, or when you come up with new ideas for strategy or capabilities, that's when you introduce OKRs, to get them done!

## OKR don't #5

**Don't rollout a single-use-app for OKRs.**

3 reasons:

1 - for many (or most) employees, it will feel like just another tracking tool, as brilliant as OKRs are, employees will hate it

2 - go for a tool that allows you to: a) evolve the strategy tree to a 12 to 36 month horizon; b) evolve the strategy, whilst at the same time running monthly/quarterly OKRs; and c) tie together execution of strategy + OKRs + daily work, in one digital workspace (thereby achieving Ray Dalio's radical transparency, with just enough structure and context)

3 - if you solve reason 2) above, you create the opportunity for your leaders to lead.  No matter how good a leader you are, and how good your work ethic and intentions are, your leadership is diluted if you are bouncing around 5-10 different apps to support your teams on strategy and execution

NB - #stratapp is the world's first and only app that achieves 2) and 3) above
