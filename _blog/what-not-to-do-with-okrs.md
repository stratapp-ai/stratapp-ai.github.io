## OKR don't #1

**Don't start with OKRs.**

Start with the strategy tree and your leadership team.

## OKR don't #2

**Don't stop evolving strategy** whilst executing your monthly or quarterly OKRs.

Strategy never stops.  Your strategy tree should be:

* live and interactive
* cascading to execution
* guided by your vision, why and direction

NB - all 6 are easy modules inside #stratapp

## OKR don't #3

**Don't say to employees: "_We are rolling out OKRs!_"**

OKRs are a key piece of the big picture.

Try this instead: _our leadership team have recently been working together in one digital workspace for ideation + strategy + execution + collaboration, and now we want to progressively open that up to the whole company, so we can evolve ideas, planning, strategy formation and strategy execution together with you_

## OKR don't #4

**Don't confuse OKRs with KPIs.**

OKRs = one-off lifetime and only 2 to 4 per month or quarter for every 500 employees in your org

KPIs = ongoing lifetime and you may have 10 to 250 indicators worth tracking

When you see KPIs going off track, or when you come up with new ideas for strategy or capabilities, that's when you introduce OKRs - to get them done!

## OKR don't #5

**Don't rollout _yet another single-use-app_ for OKRs.**

3 reasons:

1 - for many (or most) employees, it will feel like a tracking or accountability tool.  As brilliant as OKRs are, if you do that, employees will hate it.

2 - go for next gen tech that allows you to: a) evolve the strategy tree to a 12 to 36 month horizon; b) evolve the strategy tree, whilst at the same time running monthly or quarterly OKRs; and c) tie together execution of strategy + OKRs + daily work, in one digital workspace (thereby achieving [Ray Dalio's radical transparency](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/radical-transparency/ "Ray Dalio's radical transparency"), with just the right amount of structure and context)

3 - if you solve 2) above, you will create the opportunity for your leaders to lead.  No matter how good your leaders are, or how good their work ethic and intentions are, leadership is critically diluted if they are bouncing around 5 different apps to support their teams on strategy and execution.

NB - #stratapp is the world's first (and thus far only) B2B SaaS app that achieves 2) and 3) above.  By the time our app is copied by others we will already be onto phase 2 of our **_5 phase strategic roadmap_**.  Please join the #stratapp tribe on evolving this new way of thinking on **_how best to use tech to lead a company_**.
