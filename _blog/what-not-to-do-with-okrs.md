## OKRs don't #1

**Don't start with OKRs.**

Start with the strategy tree and your leadership team.

NB - after reading this article, [watch this short video](https://youtu.be/DqsXkZs75Lk "the leadership cycle") to learn about the leadership cycle and strategy tree

## OKRs don't #2

**Don't stop evolving your strategy** whilst executing monthly or quarterly OKRs.

Strategy formation and evolution should never stop.  Your strategy tree should be:

* live and interactive
* accessible to everyone
* cascading to execution
* guided by your vision, why and direction

## OKRs don't #3

**Don't say to employees: "_We are rolling out OKRs_"**

OKRs are one piece of a bigger picture.

OKRs are brilliant for strategy execution, however there is increasing confusion and misunderstandings on OKRs - especially from folks who only scratch the service when trying to learn something new.

We recommend communicating with the bigger picture: _our leadership team have recently been working together in one digital workspace for ideation + planning + strategy + execution, and now we want to progressively open that up to the whole company, so we can evolve these together with you_

## OKRs don't #4

**Don't confuse OKRs with KPIs.**

OKRs: _one-off lifetime_, limited to only 2 to 4 objectives per quarter for every 500 employees

KPIs: _ongoing lifetime_ and you may have 10 to 250 indicators worth tracking

When you see KPIs going off track, or when you think of new ideas for strategy or capabilities, that's when you introduce OKRs - _to get it done!_

## OKRs don't #5

**Don't rollout _a single-use-app_ for OKRs.**

3 reasons to avoid single-use-apps for OKRs:

**1** - for many employees, it will feel like just another tracking or accountability tool.  As brilliant as OKRs are, if they feel that, employee adoption will fade over time.

**2** - go for _next gen tech_ that allows you to: a) create the strategy tree to a 12 to 36 month horizon; b) add OKRs to any level of the strategy tree; c) evolve and execute off the strategy tree whilst at the same time executing OKRs (i.e. per "OKR don't #2" above, strategy evolution and execution never stops); d) tie together execution of _strategy + OKRs + daily work_, into one digital workspace (thereby achieving [Ray Dalio's radical transparency](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/radical-transparency/ "Ray Dalio's radical transparency")) so that leaders can efficiently engage/contribute/support/coach at all levels on execution, in real time, rather than looking at dashboards and trying to figure out what's really happening

**3** - if you solve 2) you will create unlimited opportunities for leaders to lead, and the transparency will radically elevate org-wide performance and culture.  Think about this.  No matter how good your leaders are, or how good their work ethic and intentions are, leadership is critically diluted if bouncing across different apps and integrations to support their teams on what ends up being fragmented views of strategy and execution.

NB - #stratapp is the world's first (_and thus far only_) B2B SaaS app that achieves both 2) and 3) above.  Leaders have the opportunity to lead.  Employee rising stars have the opportunity to shine, and to receive appreciation, unconstrained by org hierarchy and political silos (you might like this [thinking on corporate hierarchy from Elon Musk](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/05/15/elon-musk-takes-on-corporate-hierarchy-in-note-to-tesla-employees/ "Elon Musk on corporate hierarchy")).

By the time we are copied by others, #stratapp will already be onto building phase 2 of our 5 phase roadmap.

Please join the #stratapp global tribe on rethinking **_how best to use tech to lead a company_**.
