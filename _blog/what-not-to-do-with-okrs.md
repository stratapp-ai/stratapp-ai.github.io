## OKR don't #1

**Don't start with OKRs.**

Start with the strategy tree and your leadership team.

## OKR don't #2

**Don't stop evolving the strategy tree** whilst executing your monthly/quarterly OKRs.

Strategy never stops.  Your strategy tree should be live and interactive.

## OKR don't #3

tip #4

tip #5

\- don't stop evolving the strategy tree whilst executing month/quarter OKRs (strategy work keeps going)

\- don't say you're rolling out OKRs (that's only one piece of the puzzle)

\- don't confuse OKRs (one-off lifetime and only 2 to 4 per quarter for every 500 employees) with KPIs (ongoing lifetime and you may have 15 to 150 indicators worth tracking)

\- don't rollout a single-use-app for OKRs (it will feel to employees as just another tracking tool)
