## OKR don't #1

**Don't start with OKRs.**

Start with the strategy tree and your leadership team.  No one else.

## OKR don't #2

**Don't stop evolving strategy** whilst executing your monthly/quarterly OKRs.

Strategy never stops.  Your strategy tree should be:

* live and interactive
* cascading to execution
* guided by your vision, why and direction

NB - all 6 are easy modules inside #stratapp

## OKR don't #3

**Don't say to employees: "We are rolling out OKRs!"**

OKRs are a key piece of a bigger puzzle.

Try this instead: _the leadership team have recently been working together in one digital workspace for ideation + strategy + execution + collaboration, and now we want to progressively open that up to the whole company, so we can evolve ideas, planning, strategy formation and strategy execution together_

## OKR don't #4

**Don't confuse OKRs with KPIs.**

OKRs = one-off lifetime and only 2 to 4 per month or quarter for every 500 employees in your org

KPIs = ongoing lifetime and you may have 15 to 150 indicators that are worth tracking

When you see KPIs going off track, or when you come up with new ideas for strategy or capabilities, that's when you introduce OKRs - to get them done!

## OKR don't #5

**Don't rollout a single-use-app for OKRs.**

3 reasons:

1 - for many (or most) employees, it will feel like just another tracking tool.  As brilliant as OKRs are, if you do that employees will hate it.

2 - go for a tool that allows you to: a) evolve the strategy tree to a 12 to 36 month horizon; b) evolve the strategy tree, whilst at the same time running monthly/quarterly OKRs; and c) ties together execution of strategy + OKRs + daily work, in one digital workspace (thereby achieving Ray Dalio's radical transparency, with just the right amount of structure and context)

3 - if you solve reason 2) above, you will create the opportunity for your leaders to lead.  No matter how good your leaders are, or how good their work ethic and intentions are, leadership is critically diluted if bouncing around 5 different apps to support teams on strategy and execution.

NB - #stratapp is the world's first and only app that achieves 2) and 3).  By the time we are copied we will be onto phase 2 of our 5 phase roadmap, so please join us on this new way of thinking on how best to use tech to lead a company.
