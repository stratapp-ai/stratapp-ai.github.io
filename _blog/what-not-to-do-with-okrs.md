## OKR don't #1

**Don't start with OKRs.**

Start with the strategy tree and your leadership team.

NB - [watch this](https://youtu.be/DqsXkZs75Lk "the leadership cycle") to learn more about the leadership cycle and strategy tree.

## OKR don't #2

**Don't stop evolving your strategy** whilst executing monthly or quarterly OKRs.

Strategy formation and evolution should never stop.  Your strategy tree should be:

* live and interactive
* accessible to everyone
* cascading to execution
* guided by your vision, why and direction

NB - all 6 co-exist seamlessly inside #stratapp

## OKR don't #3

**Don't say to employees: "_We are rolling out OKRs!_"**

OKRs are only one piece of the big picture.

Try this instead: _our leadership team have recently been working together in one digital workspace for ideation + strategy + execution + collaboration, and now we want to progressively open that up to the whole company, so we can evolve ideas, planning, strategy formation and strategy execution transparently together with everyone in \[company name\]_

## OKR don't #4

**Don't confuse OKRs with KPIs.**

OKRs = have a _one-off lifetime_ and should be limited to only 2 to 4 per month or quarter for every 500 employees in your org

KPIs = have an _ongoing lifetime_ and you may have 10 to 250 indicators worth tracking

When you see KPIs going off track, or when you are thinking of new ideas for strategy or capabilities, that's when you introduce OKRs - to get it done!

## OKR don't #5

**Don't rollout _yet another single-use-app_ for OKRs.**

3 reasons:

1 - for many (or most) employees, it will feel like just another tracking or accountability tool.  As brilliant as OKRs are, if you do that, employees will hate it.

2 - go for _next gen tech_ that allows you to: a) evolve the strategy tree to a 12 to 36 month horizon; b) evolve the strategy tree, whilst at the same time executing monthly or quarterly OKRs; and c) tie together execution of strategy + OKRs + daily work, in one digital workspace (thereby achieving [Ray Dalio's radical transparency](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/radical-transparency/ "Ray Dalio's radical transparency"), with just the right amount of structure and context)

3 - if you solve 2) above, you will create unlimited opportunities for your leaders to lead.  Think about this.  No matter how good your leaders are, or how good their work ethic and intentions are, leadership is critically diluted if they are bouncing around 5 different apps to support their teams on fragmented views of strategy and execution.

NB - #stratapp is the world's first (_and thus far only_) B2B SaaS app that achieves 2) and 3) above.  By the time our app is inevitably copied by others, we will already be onto phase 2 of our **_5 phase strategic roadmap_**.  Please join the #stratapp tribe on evolving this new way of thinking on **_how best to use tech to lead a company_**.
