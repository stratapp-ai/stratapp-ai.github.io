Looking back, I wish I had #stratapp.

# my VC role

For me the post-deal aspect of the VC role was awesome, balancing time across four things:

1. Ensuring clarity on the strategy versus what we’ll achieve each quarter
2. Solving problems and assisting with talent and distribution connections
3. Searching for ways to leap-frog on growth and value creation
4. Planning ahead for the next funding or transaction milestone

# my VC reality

When I look back now I think:

* So much time, momentum and clarity gets lost between the cycle of calls/meetings/emails/reports
* Founders get overwhelmed with their own learning curve, especially as the company starts to scale, and the personal struggles they are going through often surface too late
* Strategy and execution evolves fast, and avoidable mistakes start to kick in
* The best and worst of human nature abounds, with no shortage of surprises

# what would have helped me as a VC

**Firstly**, being able to see, in real time, the exact status and underlying cadence on:

* strategy execution across goals->objectives->actions->projects
* decisions/approvals
* KPIs/OKRs
* risks/mitigations/assumptions
* projects/tasks
* challenges/ideas
* meetings/actions
* employee sentiment and engagement
* team players/innovators/rising stars
* headlines and an interactive global heatmap, showing what’s hot right now

**Secondly**, being able to freely engage in the debates, discussions and ideas taking place at all different levels inside the investee company. Breaking free of the traditional constraints of functional silos, management hierarchy and meeting cycles. 2018 saw a wave of news articles on [Elon Mask tackling the problem of silos and hierarchy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/18/elon-musks-productivity-rules-according-to-tesla-email.html&sa=D&ust=1582348134617000&usg=AFQjCNHwrSCHL54e38f2AgYLbAW5cfzL5A "Elon Mask").

**Thirdly**, embracing [radical transparency](https://stratapp.ai/blog/radical-transparency/ "radical transparency"). It is healthy for investee company management and employees to see the VC’s ongoing contributions firsthand. This builds trust and engagement, and it accelerates professional development of investee management teams. Radical Transparency was made famous by [Ray Dalio's book Principles](https://stratapp.ai/principles-by-ray-dalio-embracing-radical-transparency/ "Principles by Ray Dalio").

# VCs leveraging next gen tech to create portfolio value

\#stratapp, the [world’s first org-wide strategy execution app](https://stratapp.ai/blog/best-strategy-execution-software-app/ "world's first org-wide strategy execution app"), delivers on everything I have listed above.

I remember during 2005 to 2009 there was a wave of SaaS products for VC portfolio management. I didn’t rate them, as I thought modern CRMs were perfect for tracking opportunities from deal generation through deal filtering and deal doing. CRMs offer way more flexibility on customising layouts, workflow, dashboards and reporting, not to mention mobile functionality. CRM companies also have bigger budgets to innovate faster.

However post-deal, the value creation work (ideas, strategies, plans, risks, projects and performance) needs to sit within the investee company itself. For two reasons: 1) subsequent round due-diligence; and 2) onboarding new hires.

Therefore, post investment, I believe VCs should encourage their invested companies to embrace #stratapp.

## due diligence & new hires

Imagine how simple due-diligence will be on subsequent funding rounds, when the investee company can show inside #stratapp everything that has taken place on the journey thus far - the struggles, the pivots and the wins, and how the culture has evolved over time. Data that is live and interactive, and therefore credible, rather than produced as a one-off exercise in an attempt to pass DD.

The same capability provides an incredible onboarding experience for the team leaders, managers and executives that join as the company scales. Taking a pause to look back and learn, is just as important as looking forward.

## investment managers & boards of directors

Technology is fast changing how boards of directors operate, especially on start-ups. Progressive company directors are proficient on SaaS apps for finance, CRM and MarTech. They don’t need to bombard management teams with questions in preparation for board meetings. Progressive company directors can actually drive the SaaS apps that generate the board reports.

The role of the board of directors encompasses strategy, execution performance, risk management and culture - which is all at their fingertips inside #stratapp. The rapidly improving aptitude and skills of investment managers and directors to embrace next gen tech is good timing for #stratapp.

# conclusions

Use a tier-1 CRM to manage deal flow, engagement, due diligence and completion, and overall portfolio compliance.

Use #stratapp inside each investee company to:

1. Accelerate strategy execution, through genuine org-wide engagement and alignment as the investee scales
2. De-risk the investment, [making risk management alive and interactive](https://stratapp.ai/blog/risk-management-short-version/ "making risk management alive and interactive") inside the investee
3. Provide depth and credibility for passing due diligence on future funding rounds
4. Improve the speed and quality of onboarding new hires as the investee company scales
