Since 2018 there has been a plethora of single-use-apps for OKRs. The good ones have pretty much the same functionality, which we've innovated further in #stratapp.

There are 3 reasons why #stratapp is the world's best OKR software application:

1. OKRs are driven off the interactive strategy tree
2. OKR execution takes place in the same digital workspace
3. Your teams can balance their time between strategy execution and daily work, in that same digital workspace

## interactive strategy tree for OKRs

\#stratapp is the world’s first app to bring all five stages of [The Leadership Cycle ](http://bit.ly/stratapp-the-leadership-cycle "The Leadership Cycle")into one digital workspace:

### strategy tree context for OKRs

Creating a strategy tree is the easiest way to engage employees on going from vision and direction, to strategy execution. Best practice is to take a 1 to 3 year time horizon for the strategy tree, and to write each level of the tree as “verb noun”, with 3 to 6 levels at each level of the tree.

There is simplicity and structure but no fixed rules in #stratapp, so you can run #stratapp in a way that suits your business, making your time-to-value days rather than months or quarters. Once you create your strategy tree, you can:

* Start executing at any point in the tree; or
* Hang OKRs off any point in the tree; or
* Do a mix of both

The beauty of hanging OKRs off your strategy tree, is that your teams then have an overall context for the OKR. Everyone can see the answer to the one burning question that arises during those tough moments on strategy execution: “Remind me again, why are we doing this?”

## OKRs in one digital workspace

The single-use-apps for OKR claim to support OKR execution, but that’s either a myth or exaggeration. Everything you ended to drive OKR execution sits inside #stratapp, in one seamless digital workspace, including 6 elements of collaboration:

### benefits of one digital workspace for OKRs

Having everything you need to execute OKRs in one digital workspace provides two enormous benefits for your business, leaders and team members:

1. (Subject to your chosen security settings) execution is transparent to everyone, thus rapidly accelerating accountability and performance
2. Engagement is elevated, as there are many reasons to be there inside the app - rather than that annoying experience of having to remember to open a single-use-OKR app just to update progress or actuals

## balancing time between strategy execution and daily work with OKRs

\#stratapp helps solve this age old problem, which has existed for hundreds of years, well before the concept of OKRs.

Most leaders and motivated employees are great at ideation, planning and coming up with a 1 to 3 year strategy tree. In fact, many studies have shown how leaders of all demographics rate themselves highly on their ability to do those things. The challenge is execution. As Chris Sacca, an investor in Twitter and Uber, famously said: “Ideas are cheap, execution is everything!”.

### OKR design thesis for #stratapp

Solving this challenge goes to the heart of the #stratapp thesis. If we can bring everything you need to do on strategy formulation, strategy execution, learning, time management and daily work, into one digital workspace - that has consistent user experience across each of those features - then we will empower each employee to optimize their own balance between working on strategy and getting their day to day work done.

We achieve this by reducing (or eliminating) integrations, app switching, data silos and misalignment.

Along the way we happen to save you 17 to 35 times on per user SaaS fees, and that saving will increase further as we deliver on the #stratapp product roadmap.

Our thesis is simple: _strategy execution wins on employee engagement._

_So, #stratapp makes it easy for you to align everyone in a way they feel empowered and part of the journey._

_Everyone can see how what they are working on contributes to the overall goal._

_No chaos. No confusion. No excuses._

_Everyone aligned. Everyone motivated._
