If you hear this from a CEO or CxO role, "Yes, our people are doing OKRs", you might want to short-the-stock and bet their OKR implementation will fail.

To be successful, OKRs need to start with the CEO and leadership team.

Ironically, that's not the actual starting point to be successful on OKRs.  Before investing time into OKRs, the leadership team first need to be aligned on the strategy tree.

## implementing OKRs - start with the strategy tree

\#stratapp is the [best OKR software app in the world right now](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/best-OKR-software-app/ "best OKR software app"), and a key reason for that is how #stratapp brings strategy, OKRs and execution into one digital workspace:

In #stratapp, you hang the OKRs off the interactive strategy tree.

Not all execution needs to be done through OKRs, so #stratapp has been designed with this real world perspective in mind.  That is, the 6 elements of collaboration power both the strategy tree and OKRs.  So you can execute strategy in a way that best suits your business and each scenario.

### step #1

Start with the strategy tree, and the leadership team.

We define the "leadership team" as the owner/CxOs or top 10 in the organization - whichever number is smaller.  We keep in mind that [most leaders know where they are heading](https://bit.ly/stratapp-engaging-people "engaging people"), it is strategy execution that rarely meets expectations.

### step #2 - evolve the strategy tree, be agile

We don't need the strategy tree to be perfect.  Our first step is to switch from static strategy documents, spreadsheets and email, to collaborating in real time off the strategy tree.  Once we master this, we then move onto OKRs.

### step #3 - Workshop A - one digital workspace

In this 60min hands-on Workshop A, we aim to have the leadership team comfortable with working in one digital workspace, which means:

* creating and evolving the strategy tree (remembering step #2)
* powering the strategy tree with 6 elements of collaboration - switching from multiple apps and communication mediums, to one digital workspace (initially for the purpose of aligning to and evolving the strategy tree)
* understanding security/confidentiality and how to leverage @org-design
* running your meetings and meeting actions in the app

Just like learning a new language or preparing for a big sporting event, you now jump in and commit daily for the next 7-21 days.

At this point we have the OKRs page in #stratapp turned off, so there is no problem adding other users below the leadership team, to collaborate on aspects that hang off daily meetings or the strategy tree.

### step #4 - Workshop B - big bang value

After 7-21 days mastering _one digital workspace_, your leadership team will start to see several opportunities for big bang value.

We then run an interactive Workshop B, which is a mix of:

* Shaping those ideas and opportunities
* Sharing generic best practices (that is without compromising the confidentiality or IP of other clients)

## implementing OKRs - go back a step if you need to

With solid alignment of the leadership team and real-time collaboration in one digital workspace - evolving the strategy tree - your organization is now ready to embrace the brilliant OKR methodology for strategy execution.

If that's not the case, then you may need to go back a step to apply one or both of these strategy pages inside #stratapp:

* our why - [Simon Sinek's](https://stratappsaas.com/how-great-leaders-inspire-action-by-simon-sinek/ "Simon Sinek") framework for establishing a solid belief foundation, that engages customers and employees
* direction - [Professor Roger Martin's](https://stratappsaas.com/professor-roger-martin-on-what-ceos-should-really-be-doing/ "Professor Roger Martin") framework for setting a direction, so that the leadership team and management can shape strategy execution

## implementing OKRs - run the first quarter with CxO roles only

Although #stratapp and OKRs are both all about engaging everyone, success starts at the top, hence the focus of steps 1 to 5.

### step #5 - starting with the leadership team 

## implementing OKRs - progressive rollouts
