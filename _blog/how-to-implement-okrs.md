If you hear this from a CEO or CxO role: "_Yes, our employees are doing OKRs_", you might want to short-the-stock because their OKR implementation will most likely fail.

OKRs are brilliant for strategy execution.  However, to be successful, OKRs need to start with the CEO and leadership team.

Ironically, OKRs in themselves are not the starting point for successful implementation.

Before adopting OKRs, the leadership team first need to be aligned on the strategy tree.

## implementing OKRs - the strategy tree

Best practice is to align your OKRs to the strategy tree:

\#stratapp allows you the flexibility to hang OKRs off any level in the strategy tree.

\#stratapp is the [best OKR software app in the world right now](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/best-OKR-software-app/ "best OKR software app"), and a key reason for that is how #stratapp brings _strategy + OKRs + execution_ into one digital workspace: 

![](/uploads/strategy-okrs-execution.jpg)

Important to note, not all of the strategy execution needs to be done through OKRs, so #stratapp has been designed with this real-world perspective in mind.  

That is, the 6 elements of collaboration power both the strategy tree and OKRs.  So you can execute strategy in a way that best suits your business and each scenario.  You don't have to change your business to suit the app.

\#stratapp is powered by @org-design, so it works seamlessly for 5 to 500,000 employees.

### step #1 - start with the strategy tree

Step #1 is to start with the strategy tree and the _leadership team_.

We define the leadership team as the top 10 to 15 in the organization - this will be less for smaller companies.

We start with the strategy tree and the leadership team because [most leaders know where they are heading](https://bit.ly/stratapp-engaging-people "engaging people"), it is strategy execution that rarely meets expectations.

### step #2 - evolve the strategy tree, be agile

You don't need the strategy tree to be perfect.  You just need to start.

Step #2 is to switch from static strategy documents, spreadsheets, email and chat groups, to collaborating in real-time off the strategy tree - with context and structure.

Once the leadership team master this, you can then move onto OKRs.

### step #3 - Workshop A - one digital workspace

In this 60min hands-on Workshop A, we aim to have the leadership team comfortable with working in _one digital workspace_, which means:

* creating and evolving the strategy tree (remembering step #2)
* powering the strategy tree with 6 elements of collaboration - switching from multiple apps and communication mediums, to _one digital workspace_ (initially for the purpose of aligning to and evolving the strategy tree)
* understanding security/confidentiality and how to leverage @org-design
* running meetings and meeting actions - with context and structure

Just like learning a new language or preparing for a big sporting event, the leadership team then jump in and commit daily for the 7-21 days subsequent to Workshop A.

Note, at this step #3 we still have the OKRs module in #stratapp turned off, so there is no problem adding other people below the leadership team to collaborate on meetings/tasks/initiatives and the strategy tree.

### step #4 - Workshop B - big bang value

After 7-21 days mastering _one digital workspace_, your leadership team will start to see several opportunities for big bang value.

We then run an interactive Workshop B, which is a mix of:

* Shaping those ideas and opportunities
* Sharing generic best practices (that is without compromising the confidentiality or IP of other clients)

This aligns the leadership team on how they want to evolve the _one digital workspace_, providing clarity and consensus, before adding OKRs and cascading them org-wide.

## implementing OKRs - regroup if needed

With solid alignment of the leadership team and real-time collaboration in _one digital workspace_ and evolving the strategy tree, your organization is now ready to embrace the brilliant OKR methodology for strategy execution.

If that's not the case, then you may need to regroup and apply one or both of these strategy pages inside #stratapp:

* our why - [Simon Sinek's](https://stratappsaas.com/how-great-leaders-inspire-action-by-simon-sinek/ "Simon Sinek") framework for establishing a solid belief foundation, that engages customers and employees
* direction - [Professor Roger Martin's](https://stratappsaas.com/professor-roger-martin-on-what-ceos-should-really-be-doing/ "Professor Roger Martin") framework for setting a direction, so that the leadership team and management can then shape the strategy tree and execution

Like most of the pages in #stratapp, you can turn them on/off by team or individual - you don't have to change your business to suit the app - so you don't have to apply these "our why" and "direction" pages as part of regrouping, that decision is up to you.

## implementing OKRs - run the first quarter with CxO roles only

Although OKRs are all about [engaging everyone](https://bit.ly/stratapp-engaging-people "engaging people"), success starts at the top, so that remains the focus of steps 1 to 5.

### step #5 - starting with the leadership team

With the leadership team now aligned on the strategy tree, the next step is to agree OKRs for the first OKR period.  Most organizations opt for a quarterly cycle, however early-stage companies might prefer to set their OKRs monthly.

For this first OKR period, we recommend:

* Starting with no more than 2x OKRs and 2-4 key results per OKR
* Allocating ownership of each objective and key result to different members of the leadership team
* Adding all of the leadership team as members on each objective and key result card - you won't do this later, but for the first OKR period this is an important tip
* Keeping the security level on each to the lowest level, where you're able to do so

Each objective and key result card will then be powered by the 6 elements of collaboration.  This may involve adding employees who are outside of the leadership team, but as mentioned above you don't need to publish the OKR module to everyone just yet.

## implementing OKRs - progressive rollouts

The trick here is not to announce you are "_rolling out OKRs_", as that tends to create a mixed reaction from employees.  Most people new to OKRs misunderstand the OKR methodology and why it is so brilliant - for the organization and for them.

Instead, we recommend you go for an angle that is less threatening and more aspirational, something like this:

_the leadership team have recently been collaborating in one digital workspace for strategy + execution + collaboration, and now we want to progressively open that up to the whole company, so we can evolve ideas, planning, strategy and execution together_

As you're adding each group of employees, you may decide to share these two presentations: [engaging people](https://bit.ly/stratapp-engaging-people "engaging people") and [the leadership cycle](https://bit.ly/stratapp-the-leadership-cycle "the leadership cycle").

### step #6 - cascading 'one digital workspace'

We recommend cascading your rollout in 5 stages:

* rollout stage 1 - leadership team - top 10 to 15 (less for small companies)
* rollout stage 2 - expand to 25 (including the leadership team)
* rollout stage 3 - expand to 50
* rollout stage 4 - expand to 100
* rollout stage 5 - org-wide

We recommend you allow 2 to 3 weeks in-between each rollout stage.

This approach solves three aspects:

* Leaders get to lead by example - not just at the easy beginning, but all of the way through to successful adoption and having a positive impact on strategy execution
* Context, collaboration and cadence improves progressively - learn as you go
* When employees are added, there is "_movement at the station_" - to use an old saying from Australian sheep and cattle farmers - that is, a reason to be there and engage

### step #7 - an OKR consultant, skilled in change

When it comes to cascading OKRs, most larger companies will hire an OKR coach who has a background in change management consulting.

If you feel that's the right choice for your organization, we recommend doing that just before rollout stage 3 - expanding to 50.  

Stages 1 and 2 beforehand will give you great insight to the challenges you may or may not be facing, and the ideal profile of consultant you need to hire.

## implementing OKRs - decouple remuneration from OKRs

Most practitioners, including the father of OKRs, Intel’s Andy Grove, and the pioneers since, firmly believe that remuneration should be decoupled from OKRs. 

At #stratapp, we share the same view.  You want people to take risks and to strive for objectives that are ambitious and motivating. That’s how you transform organizations, create new markets and innovate beyond what competitors believe is possible.
