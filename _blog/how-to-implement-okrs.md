If you hear this from a CEO or CxO role, "Yes, our people are doing OKRs", you might want to short-the-stock and bet their OKR implementation will fail.

To be successful, OKRs need to start with the CEO and leadership team.

Ironically, that's not the actual starting point to be successful on OKRs.  Before investing time into OKRs, the leadership team first need to be aligned on the strategy tree.
