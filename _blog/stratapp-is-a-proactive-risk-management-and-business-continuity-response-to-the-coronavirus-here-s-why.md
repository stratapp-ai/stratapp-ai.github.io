We thought employees needed these five things to work effectively from home:

1. Reliable fast internet and power
2. Physical space and devices
3. Email and shared docs
4. Social and work collaboration tools
5. Mutual trust, positivity, recognition and commitment

## new thinking on what's missing

To make working from home, or anywhere else, both effective and sustainable, employees need one more thing:

**Context!**

\#stratapp makes it easy for business owners, CEOs, executives, managers and team leaders to deliver context - seamlessly connecting strategy/vision/plans with day to day work/engagement/collaboration.

Context is the key to making remote working successful and sustainable.

### strategic context

* Why does my organization exist? \[a la [Simon Sinek](https://stratapp.ai/how-great-leaders-inspire-action-by-simon-sinek/ "how great leaders inspire action by Simon Sinek")\]
* What is our winning aspiration? \[a la [Professor Roger Martin](https://stratapp.ai/professor-roger-martin-on-what-ceos-should-really-be-doing/ "what CEOs should really be doing by Professor Roger Martin")\]
  * Where to play?
  * How to win?
  * What capabilities do we need?
  * What management systems do we need?
* What is our plan to get there? \[[cascading our strategy as a logical hierarchy](https://stratapp.ai/blog/strategic-planning-software-with-a-strategy-tree-hierarchy/ "strategy tree - 2 tips")\]
  * Goals -> Objectives -> Actions -> Projects

**good news:** each of these _strategic contexts_ are easy features inside #stratapp.

### day-to-day context

* Who is working on what right now?
* How is my team going?
* What should I work on next to have the greatest impact?
* How are each of these digital items connected?
  * This meeting
  * The task this meeting relates to
  * The workboard that task sits on
  * The strategic objective that workboard belongs to
  * The strategic goal above that objective
  * The overall why and direction that strategic goal is pointing at

**good news:** each of these _day to day contexts_ are powered by #stratapp, as an intuitive org-wide experience that actually works.

## new thinking on social-with-structure

\#stratapp wasn't the first company to think of this, but we are the first to bring it to market.

\#stratapp allows you to tag your social posts as one of ten categories:

* comment
* agree
* disagree
* question
* task
* risk
* idea
* decision
* approval
* note that

Why? This saves everybody an enormous amount of time. Not only for your recipients, but also for you when coming back to check what you have asked, assigned or provided to others.

_Example #1_

_I’ve been away for 72 hours. What strategy related questions have been asked, and what decisions or approvals have been made, whilst I was away? Great, now let’s narrow that down further to only the strategy aspects I own or am directly involved in._

_Example #2_

_For the risks, ideas and challenges I currently own, what is the status of tasks I have assigned to others?_

_Example #3_

_Who is having the most influence on strategy or KPI related work? Who are the emerging team players on KPIs? Who are the emerging innovators on strategy?_

To learn more about the power of social with structure, you can read [Atlassian thought of it, #stratapp’s done it](https://stratapp.ai/blog/atlassian-stride-social-with-structure/ "Atlassian thought of it, #stratapp's done it").

## new thinking on scaling through offshoring

I am talking about achieving scale, **not** removing or replacing your onshore talent.

### fast track the development of your best talent

I use hybrid offshoring to accelerate the professional development of our best people.

It is often not cost, time or risk feasible to build up an onshore team of 5 employees under a 25 year old. However the combination of #stratapp and a hybrid approach to offshoring opens up new possibilities.

Rather than have that onshore 25 year old working 120% of the working week, I teach each of them to split their time to:

* 50% producing
* 20% improving how work gets done
* 30% managing a team of 5 people offshore

Assuming the 5x offshore team members are each effective to a net 75% (adjusting for admin, learning, development and internal events) we have now increased the overall capacity of that 25 year old to 425%.  Pause for a moment, think about that.

I also ask them to dial back to 100%, rather than work 120%, so they can invest more personal time into fitness, recreation, learning, loved ones and family.

Not only that, our 25 year olds are now on a fast track to professional development, rapidly learning new skills on managing people, x-border cultural differences and how to “work on the business” not just in it.  That's incredible learning and development at such a young age.

If you multiply this effect across 50x 25 year olds in your company, you create an enormous capability to scale, both up AND down.  In one relatively easy strategic move you increase morale, profits and resilience, whilst de-risking the overall business.

### the next evolution of hybrid offshoring

Several years ago I started developing and applying this hybrid approach to offshoring. I didn’t foresee it back then, but now we find ourselves at the next evolution: thinking about how to scale up and give early career development experience to our best people in the Philippines.

That is, we are exploring which countries to add new team members to work for our emerging best talent in Philippines?  As my mate Rob says: "Ash, you're offshoring the offshoring!"
