# why?

If you know what's going on, at all levels in the client's organization, you can add more value.  Not only that, the client's CEO and leadership team have a tangible context for considering your ideas and proposals.

## consulting sales today

Consulting sales today are highly dependent on a few key relationships.  By investing thoughtful effort into time consuming lunches, dinners and workshops, consultants try to understand and define _the problem_, before scoping out potential ways to help.

* Visibility is subjective, and limited to these key relationships
* Deliverables are point-in-time static documents
* Consultants get (partly) blamed for subsequent poor execution
* Onselling additional work takes a lot of time and effort, and some luck

## consulting sales in future

\#stratapp changes the game on how consulting work gets identified, scoped, sold and delivered.

How?  #stratapp provides more data and insights than any other tech.

* See everything objectively, at all levels in real time
* Deliver work in a way that is alive and interactive
* Derisk your work, by proactively assisting on blockers
* Onsell with real data, genuine insights and aligned interests

Of course, what the consultant can see and edit inside #stratapp is controlled by the client.

### more insights than any other tech

Imagine if you could see, in just a few seconds, the exact status and underlying cadence of the client's:

* strategy execution across goals -> sub-goals ->actions -> projects
* OKRs - balancing strategy execution with daily work | live dashboards
* risks/mitigations/assumptions
* projects/tasks
* challenges/ideas
* meetings/actions
* employee sentiment and engagement
* team players/innovators/rising stars
* interactive global heatmap, showing what's hot right now

#### go deeper

Imagine filtering by unlimited combinations of geography, levels, functions, verticals and horizontals.

This level of real time alignment and insight is unprecedented in B2B tech - giving progressive CEOs, leaders, employees and consultants unlimited opportunities to innovate strategy execution and day to day work.

### consulting deliverables (no more static docs)

Old school consulting deliverables, in the form of point-in-time static docs, are time consuming, hugely unproductive, 'top down' by nature and fast out of date.

One-off project management software doesn't help either.  It is expensive, complex to use and understood by less than 5% of employees.

Sustaining strategy execution, business transformation and culture elevation requires a fresh new approach and genuine org-wide engagement.

Consultants and clients need collaboration tech that is:

* **agile** - alive and interactive, evolving as the execution provides more insights
* **inclusive** - a user experience and price price that achieves org-wide engagement
* **easy** - naturally intuitive, making the time to value of minutes, not weeks
* **lasting** - adds value to the client beyond the life of the consulting engagement
* **efficient** - helps CTOs to eliminate single-purpose-apps and integrations
* **multi-dimensional** - helps every employee execute both strategic and day to day work
* **next Gen ready** - [millennials](https://stratapp.ai/blog/radical-transparency/ "millennials") will be 75% of the workforce by 2025
