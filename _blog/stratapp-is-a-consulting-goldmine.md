**#stratapp is a consulting goldmine!**

# Why?

If you know what's going on, at all levels in the client's organization, you can add more value.  Not only that, the client's CEO and leadership team have a tangible context for collaborating on your ideas and proposals.

## Consulting Sales Today

Consulting sales today are highly dependent on a few key relationships.  By investing energy into time consuming lunches, dinners and workshops, consultants try to understand and define _the problem_, before scoping out potential ways to help.

* Visibility is subjective, and limited to these key relationships
* Deliverables are point-in-time static documents
* Consultants get (partly) blamed for subsequent poor execution
* Onselling additional work takes a lot of time, energy and luck

## Consulting Sales Future

\#stratapp changes the game on how consulting work gets identified, scoped, sold and delivered.

How?  #stratapp provides more data and insights than any other tech.

* See everything objectively, at all levels in real time
* Deliver work in a way that is alive and interactive
* Derisk your work, by proactively assisting on blockers
* Onsell with data, genuine insights and aligned interests

Of course, what the consultant can see and edit inside #stratapp is controlled by the client.

### More Insights Than Any Other Tech

Imagine if you could see, in just a few seconds, the exact status and underlying cadence of the client's:

* strategy execution across goals->objectives->actions->projects
* KPIs/OKRs
* risks/mitigations/assumptions
* projects/tasks
* challenges/ideas
* meetings/actions
* employee sentiment and engagement
* team players/innovators/rising stars
* interactive global heatmap, showing what's hot right now

Imagine filtering by unlimited combinations of geography, levels, functions, verticals and horizontals.

This level of real time alignment and insight is truly unprecedented in B2B tech - giving progressive CEOs, leaders, employees and consultants unlimited opportunities to innovate strategy execution and day to day work.

### Consulting Deliverables (no more static docs)

Old school consulting deliverables, in the form of point-in-time static docs, are time consuming, hugely unproductive, 'top down' by nature and fast out of date.

One-off project management software doesn't help either.  It is expensive, complex to use and understood by less than 5% of employees.

Sustaining strategy execution, business transformation and culture elevation requires a fresh new approach and genuine org-wide engagement.

Consultants and clients need collaboration tech that is:

* **Agile** - alive and interactive, evolving as the execution provides more insights
* **Inclusive** - a user experience and price that achieves org-wide engagement
* **Easy** - naturally intuitive, making the time to value of minutes, not weeks
* **Lasting** - adds value to the client beyond the life of the consulting engagement
* **Efficient** - helping CTOs to eliminate single-purpose-apps and integrations
* **Dual** - helps every employee execute both strategic and day to day work
* **Next Gen ready** - noting [millennials](https://stratapp.ai/blog/radical-transparency/ "millennials") will be 75% of the workforce by 2025
