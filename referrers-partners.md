**Agreement for Referrers & Partners**

Last Updated: November 12, 2020

This Agreement applies to any individual or entity who collaborates with us as a referrer or business partner - including end users of #stratapp who refer clients to us.

## Interpretation and Definitions

### **Interpretation**

The words of which the initial letter is capitalized have a defined meaning. The following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or in plural.

### **Definitions**

For the purposes of this Agreement:

**Active** and **Inactive**, with respect to Business Partners, are defined in this Agreement.

**Business Partner** is a person or entity confirmed in writing by us that we recognize them as a Business Partner of the Company. The status of Business Partner is subject to the terms of this Agreement, most notably the requirement to maintain an “Active” status.

**Client** means a person or entity using the #stratapp SaaS application offered by us.

**Client Revenue** means the SaaS fees paid to us by a Client, less local taxes and any third party fees associated with subscription billing and payment gateways.

**Company** (referred to as either "the Company", "we", "us" or "our" in this Agreement) refers to #stratapp Trading Pty Ltd, Level 2 32 Park Road, Milton QLD 4064, Australia.

**Confidential Information** is defined in this Agreement.

**Direct Referral** means a Registered Prospect who has been introduced to us by a Referrer; see also Indirect Referral.

**First Payment Date** means the date we first receive cleared funds to our payment gateway on SaaS fees paid by a Client.

**For Life** is defined in this Agreement.

**Indirect Referral** means a Registered Prospect who has been introduced to us by a Referrer or Business Partner, who has been introduced to us by a Business Partner.

**Partner** means any person or entity we collaborate with to generate revenue.

**Payment Method** means Paypal or Payoneer, or any other means of funds transfer chosen by the Company from time to time. Transaction fees incurred on the Payment Method will be at the cost of the recipient.

**Referral Fees** means the fees we pay to you, calculated as the Referral Fees Percentage of Client Revenue, on Clients that result from a prospect Client that has been registered to you by us as a Registered Prospect. Referrers are under no expectation or obligation to share with the Company a percentage of their advisory or consulting fees earned from implementing and supporting Clients on #stratapp; that is, referral fees are unidirectional to the Referrer.

**Referral Fees Percentage** means 10%.

**Referrer** means any person or entity, including end users, who refer a potential Client.

**Registration Process** is defined in this Agreement.

**Registered Prospect** means a potential Client that has been registered with us by a Referrer, in accordance with our Registration Process.

**#stratapp** means either the Company or the SaaS application offered by the Company.

**Threshold** is defined in this Agreement.

## Referral Fees

### **Registration Process**

To register a potential Client, the Referrer must email the following details to [sales@stratapp.ai](mailto:sales@stratapp.ai) prior to the Client’s First Payment Date:

* Client’s company name*
* Client’s website URL*
* Client contact’s firstname and lastname*
* Client contact’s email
* Date the Client has expressed an interest to learn more about or to use #stratapp*
* Client contact’s LinkedIn profile URL (if known)
* Client contact’s location, nearest town (if known)

\* required information

Within 14 days of receiving the required information above, the Company will have the discretion to choose whether or not to accept the prospect. If you do not hear back from us within 14 days of receiving all of the required information above to [sales@stratapp.ai](mailto:sales@stratapp.ai), the Client will be automatically registered to you as a Registered Prospect.

We may offer to register to you a Client lead that is generated elsewhere - for example, in a scenario where we are seeking to collaborate with you on closing a lead. To accept this offer, and for that Client to become a Registered Prospect, you will need to confirm your acceptance in writing to [sales@stratapp.ai](mailto:sales@stratapp.ai) within 14 days of the offer.

### **Multiple Referrers**

We may encounter a scenario of more than one Referrer recommending #stratapp into different Client entities, divisions, business units or functions.

In this scenario, the allocation of Referral Fees across more than one Referrer will be at the sole discretion of the Company.

Similarly, if in our assessment a different entity, division, business unit or function of a Client starts to use #stratapp through no substantial influence of another that is a Registered Prospect, then any payment of Referral Fees will be at the sole discretion of the Company.

All decisions by the Company, including those on the basis of sole discretion, must be communicated in writing by the Company and either from or copied to [sales@stratapp.ai](mailto:sales@stratapp.ai) to be effective.

### **Threshold**

Referral Fees are earned once the Registered Prospect reaches a Threshold of 20 or more paid users.

### **Referral Fees Calculation**

Referral Fees are capped to the first 18 months from the Client’s First Payment Date.

Business Partners receive more favourable terms (see below).

### **Payment**

Payment of Referral Fees will be made quarterly by the Company to the Referrer, within 28 days of quarter end. All amounts payable by us to you are subject to offset by us against any amounts owed by you to us.

Payments will be made to the Referrer’s nominated entity using the Payment Method.

Payment is subject to the Company having sufficient free cashflow (excluding capital reserves and capital raising), as determined by the directors of the Company each quarter.

Unpaid Referral Fees will accrue at 10% per annum interest in favour of the Referrer, compounding annually, as an unsecured liability until paid by the Company.

### **Transparency - Referrers**

Referrers may request in writing, during January to February each year, an annual statement of Referral Fees by Client for the prior calendar year. The Company will provide that annual statement within 28 days of receiving the request.

Referrers may request, to a limit of one request per year, the Company to undertake an internal review of Referral Fees by Client for the prior quarter. The Company will provide the conclusion of that review within 28 days of receiving the request.

## Business Partners

### **Invitation Only**

The Company may invite selected Referrers to become Business Partners.

The invitation offered by the Company, and any subsequent acceptance by the Referrer, must each be in writing and either from or copied to [sales@stratapp.ai](mailto:sales@stratapp.ai). The Referrer must accept the invitation offer within 28 days, or the offer will automatically lapse.

### **Business Partners - Active**

To retain the status and benefits of a Business Partner, the Business Partner must be “Active”.

The Company has a relatively low threshold for maintaining an Active status, defined as:

* Adding one or more Referrers in any 12 month rolling period, who in turn refer 50 or more new paid users within that same period; or
* Directly referring 250 or more new paid users in any 12 month rolling period

For the avoidance of doubt, “new paid users” means a new paid user subscription added to #stratapp, for a user that was not subscribed prior to the 12 month rolling period.

### **Business Partners - Inactive**

A Business Partner will automatically become “Inactive” when the above tests are not met. This change in status does not require detection by, or a notice from, the Company.

Upon becoming Inactive, the Business Partner will automatically revert to the status of Referrer. Referral Fees will continue to apply, on Direct Referrals, per the usual entitlements of a Referrer.

For the Referrer to become a Business Partner again, the Company must first extend a new invitation per the Invitation Only terms in this Agreement. Upon re-invitation and acceptance, the Business Partner’s entitlement to “2-Levels of Referral Fees” will be reinstated, including on those Clients that were introduced prior to reinstatement.

### **2-Levels of Referral Fees**

Business Partners earn Referral Fees on both Direct Referrals and Indirect Referrals.

For so long as the Business Partner’s status is Active, Referral Fees on Direct Referrals and Indirect Referrals will run “for life” on the applicable Clients.

For the avoidance of doubt, “for life” in this context means for so long as the Client continues to pay their SaaS fees to #stratapp, noting Client Revenue will vary based on the number of paid users each month.

The cascading of Referral Fees is limited to 2-Levels. For example:

_ABC Consulting introduces DEF Consulting, who have 100 paid users on #stratapp. DEF Consulting introduce GHI Consulting, who have 50 paid users on #stratapp. GHI Consulting refers Client XYZ, who have 500 paid users on #stratapp._

_Let’s assume ABC and DEF are active Business Partners, and that GHI Consulting is a Referrer yet to be invited as a Business Partner. Therefore, the Referral Fees will apply as follows:_

* _ABC to receive Referral Fees for life on 100 paid users of DEF_
* _ABC to receive Referral Fees for life on the 50 paid users of GHI_
* _ABC does not receive Referral fees on the 500 paid users of XYZ_
* _DEF to receive Referral Fees for life on 50 paid users of GHI_
* _DEF to receive Referral Fees for life on the 500 paid users of XYZ_
* _GHI to receive Referral Fees for up to 18 months on the 500 paid users of XYZ_

### **Protection of Confidential Information**

A right under this Agreement may only be waived in writing signed by the party granting the waiver, and is effective only to the extent specifically set out in that waiver.

### **Jurisdiction**

Queensland (Australia) law governs this Agreement. Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Queensland courts and courts competent to hear appeals from those courts.
