faqs:
- question: Do you offer a free trial?
  answer: |-
    We offer a 15 day free trial, plenty of time to get started and familiar with #stratapp.

    In fact, clients can easily achieve an org-wide rollout within that timeframe.

    There are no set-up fees or hardware costs, and you do not need technical skills to configure and deploy #stratapp.  It is also easy to deploy specific pages of the app, right down to individual users, thereby making your rollout progressive and hopefully eliminating the need for end user training.

    Most clients are up and running within 2 cups of tea or coffee, a far cry from the weeks or months it usually takes to deploy enterprise software.
- question: How does annual billing work?  What is the currency and contract term?
  answer: |-
    You can choose from monthly or annual billing, payable in advance.  Annual pricing is discounted 22-29% on monthly pricing.

    Pricing shown above is US$.

    There is no contract term beyond the billing cycle chosen by the client.
- question: What payment methods do you accept?
  answer: |-
    We accept all major credit and debit cards, including American Express, Visa, Mastercard and Diners Club.

    Payments are securely processed through the Stripe payment gateway. We do not hold or access credit card details.
- question: How do we access billing and past invoices?
  answer: Our billing engine runs on the secure Chargebee platform, which provides
    you with a client portal to access your subscription status, payment methods,
    billing information, payment history and invoices.
- question: Do you offer implementation support?
  answer: |-
