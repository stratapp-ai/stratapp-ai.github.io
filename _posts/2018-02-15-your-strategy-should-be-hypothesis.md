## strategy should be constantly evolving - not static or annual.

This article on evolving strategy as you learn, goes to the heart of #stratapp.

We wholeheartedly agree and go further to say that strategy should be given a heartbeat, freed from static documents that are out of date within weeks and soon forgotten by the next quarter.  Enter #stratapp, where your strategy and execution can be transparently evolved in real time.

“What is new is the idea that closing the gap between strategy and execution may not be about better execution after all, but rather about better learning — about more dialogue between strategy and operations, a greater flow of information from customers to executives, and more experiments. In today’s fast-paced world, strategy as learning must go hand in hand with execution as learning — bypassing the idea that either a strategy or the execution is flawed — to recognize that both are necessarily flawed and both are valuable sources of learning, improvement, and reinvention.”
