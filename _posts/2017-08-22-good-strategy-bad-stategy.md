## Richard Rumelt is brilliant!

In our view, this is the all time greatest thinking and resource for developing and executing strategy.

As Chuck Harrington, CEO of Parsons Corporation, says: “Richard Rumelt reinforces that a strategy is not a goal or objectives.  It is the battle plan for action that is designed upon a unique set of attributes or conditions (kernels) that sets an organization apart from its competitors (leverages) and results in exceptional and sustainable profits.”

\#stratapp’s strategy tree hierarchy, collaboration workboards and org-wide social helps to bring alive this battle plan like never before.

\#stratapp provides real time, line-of-sight transparency through strategy, OKRs, people and work … bringing Richard Rumelt's battle plan alive.
