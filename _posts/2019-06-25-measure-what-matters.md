## Google has applied Andy Grove's OKR methodology every quarter since 1999.

John Doerr’s book and life’s work have given all of us access to the clear thinking and progressive management practices of Intel’s Andy Grove, who was decades ahead of his time.

Google has applied the OKR methodology every quarter since 1999, evolving it to two types of OKRs - committed and aspirational. Google expects 100% results on Committed OKRs and about 70% on Aspirational OKRs, the latter deliberately stretching the capabilities of individuals and the organization.

To achieve aspirational performance, John convincingly argues the case for decoupling salary and bonuses from OKRs, elegantly explained here: [Compensation The Right Way: Without OKRs.](https://www.whatmatters.com/resources/compensation-salary-bonuses-without-okrs)

_“Leaders must get across the why as well as the what. Their people need more than milestones for motivation. They are thirsting for meaning, to understand how their goals relate to the mission.“_

_“There are so many people working so hard and achieving so little._

_“Ideas are easy. Execution is everything.”_

_“When people have conflicting priorities or unclear, meaningless, or arbitrarily shifting goals, they become frustrated, cynical, and demotivated.”_

With #stratapp, leaders deliver org-wide clarity on the why, direction and goals, coupled with real-time collaboration and transparency on execution. This helps the CEO to bring everyone at all levels in the organization along the same journey.

OKRs can be cascaded and tracked through a hierarchy of workboards inside #stratapp, with contextual links to the corresponding strategic goals > objectives > actions > projects.

In future we will be adding more features on setting, categorizing, cascading, tracking and reviewing quarterly and annual OKRs.
