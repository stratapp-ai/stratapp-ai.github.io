## Y-gen / millennials globally embrace Simon Sinek's TED talk on 'start with why'.

_“People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe.”_

Simon Sinek has become a global phenomenon since this TED talk.

He particularly resonates with y-generation. #stratapp is deliberately designed for the current and next generation workforce - both audiences want to know why their organization exists.

Therefore, #stratapp’s strategy module includes a Why page - it is optional, but we’d love you to turn it on.
