## Professor Roger Martin is a legend on strategy.

His thinking plays well to #stratapp, the world’s first org-wide strategy application that includes execution of both strategy and day to day work, alongside social collaboration with context and structure.

“In my 36 years of working with companies, I still haven’t seen an example of a strategy that was so tightly specified that the people 'executing' it didn’t have to make major choices—choices as tricky and important as the so-called 'strategy choices' themselves.”

\#stratapp tightens this process of evolving strategic choices and progressively learning from execution, providing a real-time line-of-sight through strategy, OKRs, day to day work and culture.  This elevates collective performance by keeping everyone aligned; from board, CEO and senior executives, through to middle management, team leaders and front line employees.
