## Strategy execution and collaboration software that works out-of-the-box. 

SaaS product companies typically lock their clients into a prepaid contract, then leave the client to figure out the implementation by themselves, or with ‘_preferred partners_’.

Their approach is usually hands-off and justified as building a scalable operating model. That is, most SaaS companies see their core business as scaling lead generation, onboarding and viral growth, alongside ongoing development.

This creates a problem for the client: implementation. CRM applications are a great example. Clients get excited at what’s possible during the sales process, then find themselves with a complex product that needs to be configured from a blank shell, and having to select from a range of preferred partners offering different advice, methodologies, resources and pricing.

In contrast, #stratapp is configured to work ‘_out of the box_’, so our preferred partners and the client can focus their energy and resources on proactively managing change and getting their teams fully engaged on what’s possible and understanding how #stratapp will benefit them.

On partners, we have decided not to be hands-off. We need partners in order to scale geographically, this is unavoidable. But we are doing it differently. We have developed an implementation methodology for our partners and we have worked out what the implementation coaching costs should be for our clients, at each step in that methodology.

This approach breaks new ground for SaaS. There are three reasons we are doing this:

1. We are walking the talk on genuinely caring about our clients’ success, and to do that we need to directly influence how they are supported by our partners
2. It removes the pressure on clients, and partners, to negotiate on implementation pricing
3. It ensures a value for money outcome, for every client

We will also be breaking new ground on communities - how we bring together and collaborate across clients, partners and interested users. We will share more on that later this year.
