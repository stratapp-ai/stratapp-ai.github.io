&lt;p&gt;#stratapp applies what most CEOs, executives, managers and team leaders already know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic plan cascades as: goals &amp;gt; objectives &amp;gt; actions &amp;gt; projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At each tree level you can assign different owners, teams, workboards, tasks and KPIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPIs can be strategic or day to day, quantitative or qualitative. KPIs can be viewed as their own hierarchical tree (which automatically overlay onto a Live Org Chart), indented list or balanced scorecard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The #stratapp Live Org Chart allows for direct and indirect reporting lines, the latter for 2nd hat roles or matrix reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you would expect, risks are tracked on status, probability, impact and mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp live notes come with a purpose, agenda and clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting actions automatically appear in your workspace - so if you attend six meetings in a day, you don’t need to go back to the notes of each meeting to see your actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every module in #stratapp tracks the creator, owner and assignor, with powerful filters, sort and search across the whole app - so you can easily follow-up on work you have assigned to others or what you are responsible for right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything you need, 10-apps-in-one as a seamless user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">With #stratapp, you do not need to learn new management practices, methodologies or terms.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">strategy execution in one seamless digital workspace</title><link href="https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy-execution-in-one-seamless-digital-workspace/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="strategy execution in one seamless digital workspace" /><published>2019-06-26T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-06-26T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy%20execution%20in%20one%20seamless%20digital%20workspace</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy-execution-in-one-seamless-digital-workspace/">&lt;p&gt;Up until about 2010, there was an enthusiastic rush to add as many consumer apps to your smartphone as possible. At almost every pub or restaurant gathering you’d hear someone say: “&lt;em&gt;So, what cool new apps have you discovered this week?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar explosion of choice happened with enterprise software, fuelled on by the niche focus of venture capital and group think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as we approach 2020, for both consumer and enterprise the trend is reversing. Consumers are organizing their smartphones around the apps they really need, and companies are trying to rationalize proliferation. Companies don’t want to send employees to 10+ different apps in order to do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the small business segment, a great example of a consolidated SaaS approach is the impressive product &lt;a href=&quot;https://keap.com/keap&quot; title=&quot;https://keap.com/keap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://keap.com/keap&lt;/a&gt; - covering the whole cycle from managing leads, to doing the work, getting paid and staying connected, all in one app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predicting this reversal some years ago, the founders of #stratapp planned from the outset to roll 10-apps-into-1, as the starting point. To achieve this we had to create a UX design construct that is visually and interactively consistent across the whole application. We then took it to the next level - making the 10-apps-in-1 seamlessly interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Up until about 2010, there was an enthusiastic rush to add as many consumer apps to your smartphone as possible.

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp takes sharing freely to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 the world has seen incredible viral adoption of work collaboration apps. We estimate there are more than 100m users worldwide on the likes of Trello, Asana, Atlassian, Aha! and Basecamp. These clever apps remain mostly unheard of by corporate executives and tier-1 management consultants - and those that have heard of them, have difficulty articulating how they work or why they have become so popular. That is because all of these work collaboration apps were predominantly designed for teams of less than 15 people. By our estimate, 8-15% of employees are skilled in one or more work collaboration apps; usually those employees who work in digital, product or technology functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp changes everything, bringing this global innovation to add value to 100% of employees. We have improved on best practices and UX design to make these powerful work collaboration capabilities available to all levels of the organisation, including varying employee aptitudes towards technology. We have also added the categorisation, filters, sort, search, org structure and security features you expect as an org-wide app for 5 to 500,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then made these global best practices in work collaboration, the underlying org-wide experience for collaborating on strategy and execution - designed in a way that meets the expectations of both the current and next generation workforce.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Gallup &amp;amp; Deloitte concluded from a recent 5 year study that no factor has more impact on employee engagement than “clearly defined goals that are written down and shared freely.”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">strategy execution driven by OKRs</title><link href="https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy-execution-driven-by-OKRs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="strategy execution driven by OKRs" /><published>2019-06-23T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-06-23T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy%20execution%20driven%20by%20OKRs</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy-execution-driven-by-OKRs/">&lt;p&gt;Success on strategy executions requires us to balance strategy execution with daily work. #stratapp solves this balance in one seamless digital workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/balancing-strategy-and-daily-execution.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs, brought to fame by John Doerr and the founders of Google, are brilliant for driving strategy execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/measure-what-matters-2.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In #stratapp, OKRs become a natural part of each day, because they are part of the same digital workspace. You don’t have to open another single-use-app to update them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can cascade the OKR hierarchy, separate to the strategy tree hierarchy.  As beautifully articulated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/good-strategy-bad-strategy-by-richard-rumelt/&quot; title=&quot;Good Strategy Bad Strategy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Richard Rumelt in Good Strategy Bad Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, setting targets is not a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy tree reflects your strategy.  OKRs drive execution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Success on strategy executions requires us to balance strategy execution with daily work. #stratapp solves this balance in one seamless digital workspace.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">strategy execution balanced with easy risk management</title><link href="https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy-execution-balanced-with-easy-risk-management/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="strategy execution balanced with easy risk management" /><published>2019-06-22T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-06-22T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy%20execution%20balanced%20with%20easy%20risk%20management</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy-execution-balanced-with-easy-risk-management/">&lt;p&gt;In theory, boards of directors, CEOs and company officers are to track and manage risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this is hard to do, so often we delegate risk management to the CFO role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks typically get logged into a static document, with variable accountability and limited visibility of the risk status, impact assessment and mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp changes the game. Risk cards are living and breathing within the organization. Risk management becomes real, with clear ownership, accountability and real-time transparency on the status and the work being done to mitigate the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With #stratapp, risk management is no longer a box ticking exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk cards in #stratapp can be standalone or added to other modules, for example, cards in the strategic plan hierarchy, select KPIs or project workboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp makes it easy for everyone in the organization to identify, track and mitigate risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who can see what risks is subject to the security setting on each risk card - the same approach in #stratapp to managing security on all card types and workboards. For example, if the CEO is managing a risk in relation to cash flow, then that risk card is likely to be set as Top Secret, with visibility and access strictly limited to the members invited to that risk card by the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the other modules inside #stratapp, the design construct and UX for risk cards applies what you already know. You do not need to learn new concepts or language. As you would expect, each risk card comprises:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Status - urgent / needs attention / under control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Probability - high / medium / low&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Impact - high / medium / low&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Migitations - current and closed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WIP and collaboration - tasks, workboards and structured social&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Filtering - so you can quickly see the risks you are interested in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With #stratapp, you can collaborate in real-time with your clients, partners and suppliers, within the context of strategy and day to day work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guest users cannot see your headlines, heatmap, strategy, OKRs or content they have not been invited to.  Security also factors in paid versus guests users.  On Secret items in #stratapp, only the owner can add new members.  On Top Secret items, guest users cannot be added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With #stratapp, you can consolidate all communications into one place.  Notes from meetings and calls can be immediately added to the relevant card or workboard.  Actions from those meetings will automatically appear in your workspace, and theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you attend a meeting or conference call, know that the actions from that meeting will automatically appear in your workspace.  No need for you to go back to the original notes.  Plus in a few clicks, you can immediately track what has been delegated to you versus what you have delegated to others.  The same goes for the other modules within #stratapp.  For example, if you are reviewing a strategic goal or operational risk, any tasks added to that card will automatically appear in your workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often do you attend a meeting where everyone is writing down their own interpretation of the notes, and the actions.  Inside #stratapp Notes, you can add private notes, and with the other attendees you can together edit and agree the live notes.  The meeting has a purpose and an agenda, plus a clock that times how long has been spent on each agenda item or sub-item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drive efficiencies at all levels and improve the experience for all attendees - before, during and after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Eliminate double handling and deliver on accountability.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">strategy execution on a Live Org Chart showing who is working on what right now</title><link href="https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy-execution-on-a-live-org-chart/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="strategy execution on a Live Org Chart showing who is working on what right now" /><published>2019-06-18T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-06-18T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy%20execution%20on%20a%20live%20org%20chart</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy-execution-on-a-live-org-chart/">&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I wonder why Sam is not getting back to me, I sent him that over a week ago?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? What if you could go to a Live Org Chart and instantly see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is working for Sam on what right now?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is Sam working on right now?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What secondary responsibilities does Sam have right now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might provide some useful insights, especially if Sam is based in another function or geography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp’s Live Org Chart is powered by three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Direct reporting lines, automatically creating levels counted from the top&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indirect reporting lines, from second hat roles and responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indirect reporting lines, created live from the cards and workboards inside #stratapp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, what you can see is still subject to security settings. Restricted security, the default for org-wide collaboration and transparency, allows you to read content and to participate in social conversations. Confidential, Secret and Top Secret content will not be visible to you on the Live Org Chart, unless you have already been added as a member.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">“I wonder why Sam is not getting back to me, I sent him that over a week ago?”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">strategy execution without noise, social collaboration with context and structure</title><link href="https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy-execution-without-noise/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="strategy execution without noise, social collaboration with context and structure" /><published>2019-06-15T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-06-15T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy%20execution%20without%20noise</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stratappsaas.com/features/strategy-execution-without-noise/">&lt;p&gt;Social apps without context or structure, just add more noise. Especially as you move above 50 employees into mid-market and corporates. Social fast becomes a twitter-style fire hose of notifications, or like being on the end of hundreds of reply-all emails per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp has found a way to embrace the power of social - but with context and structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In #stratapp, most social interaction takes place within either the strategic plan or KPI hierarchy, or the individual cards for notes, tasks, risks, ideas and challenges. This naturally organizes what conversations relate to what, and why - in doing so, it kills about 90% of internal email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With #stratapp, social has structure. We were inspired by the early innovations of Stride, since acquired then buried by #slack. We’ve ratcheted the innovations of Stride up a notch. When you post or reply inside #stratapp, you can tag it as a comment, agree, disagree, question, task, risk, idea, decision, approval or something to note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably already figured out why. Not everyone in a 50, 500, 5,000 or 50,000 employee organization wants to sift through hundreds of social notifications to find exactly what they need to know. People also don’t want to open and browse each module individually (e.g. strategy, KPIs, risks, ideas and workboards).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we have extracted all social to one place. You can immediately get to exactly what you are interested in. For example, “I want to see any questions, decisions or approvals made in the last 72hrs on anything to do with our strategy.” That takes 4-5 seconds to do inside #stratapp. Of course, what you can see is subject to security settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for workboards. Whilst there might be 25 users busy and deeply engaged on a project workboard, you may not want to scroll through hundreds of notifications to keep track. Workboards in #stratapp have their own dedicated social page, where you can quickly filter to what you are interested in, for example, “I want to see any ideas, risks or questions asked on a task where I am a member of that task card.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recapping, #stratapp’s social has:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Context - naturally organizing conversations where they belong&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Structure - so you can find exactly what you are interested in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Filtering - so you don’t need to go searching or scrolling to catch up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workboard social page - so you can easily keep up and engage with the project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security - protecting the organization’s IP and who can see what&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp’s social frees your time and headspace, with a laser focus on what really matters.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Social apps without context or structure, just add more noise.
