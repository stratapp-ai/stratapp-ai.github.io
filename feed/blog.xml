The good ones have pretty much the same approach and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp takes OKRs to a whole new level, because #stratapp &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; a single-use-OKR-app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 reasons why #stratapp is the world’s best OKR software application right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKRs are driven off the interactive strategy tree&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKR execution takes place in the same digital workspace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your teams can balance their time between strategy execution and daily work - this is the secret to succeeding (or failing) on OKRs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interactive-strategy-tree-for-okrs&quot;&gt;interactive strategy tree for OKRs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is the world’s first app to bring all five stages of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-the-leadership-cycle&quot; title=&quot;The Leadership Cycle&quot;&gt;The Leadership Cycle&lt;/a&gt; into one digital workspace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/the-leadership-cycle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-tree-context-for-okrs&quot;&gt;strategy tree context for OKRs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a strategy tree is the easiest way to engage employees on going from vision and direction, to strategy execution. Best practice is to take a 1 to 3 year time horizon for the strategy tree, to write them in a “verb noun” format and to strive for 3 to 6 branches at each level of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is simplicity and structure but no fixed rules in #stratapp, so you can run #stratapp in a way that suits your business.  This makes your time-to-value days, rather than months or quarters. Once you create your strategy tree, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start executing at any point in the tree; or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hang OKRs at any point in the tree; or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do a mix of both&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of hanging OKRs off your strategy tree, is that your teams then have an overall context for the OKR. Everyone can see the answer to the one burning question that arises during those tough moments on strategy execution: “Remind me again, why are we doing this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okrs-in-one-digital-workspace&quot;&gt;OKRs in one digital workspace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some single-use-apps for OKR claim to enable OKR execution, but that’s either a myth or an exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything you ended to drive OKR execution sits inside #stratapp, in one seamless digital workspace, powered by 6 elements of collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/6-elements-of-collaboration.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-of-one-digital-workspace-for-okrs&quot;&gt;benefits of one digital workspace for OKRs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having everything you need to execute OKRs in one digital workspace provides two enormous benefits for your business, leaders and team members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Subject to your chosen security settings) execution is transparent to everyone, thus rapidly accelerating accountability and performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engagement is elevated, as there are many reasons to be there inside the app - rather than that annoying experience of having to remember to open a single-use-OKR app just to update progress or actuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;balancing-time-between-strategy-execution-and-daily-work-with-okrs&quot;&gt;balancing time between strategy execution and daily work with OKRs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp helps solve this age old problem, which existed well before the concept of OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/balancing-strategy-and-daily-execution.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most leaders and motivated employees are great at ideation, planning and coming up with a 1 to 3 year strategy tree. In fact, many studies have shown how leaders of all demographics rate themselves highly on their ability to do those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is execution. As Chris Sacca, an investor in Twitter and Uber, famously said:&lt;br /&gt;
“&lt;em&gt;Ideas are cheap, execution is everything!&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solving-the-challenge-of-okr-execution&quot;&gt;solving the challenge of OKR execution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving this challenge goes to the heart of the #stratapp thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can bring everything you need to do on strategy formulation, strategy execution, learning, time management and daily work, into one digital workspace - that has consistent user experience across each of those features - then we will empower each employee to optimize their own balance between working on strategy and getting their day to day work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We achieve this by reducing (or eliminating) integrations, app switching, data silos and misalignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way we happen to save you 17 to 35 times on per user SaaS fees, and that saving will increase further as we deliver on the #stratapp product roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our thesis is simple: &lt;em&gt;strategy execution wins on employee engagement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp makes it easy for you to align everyone in a way they feel empowered and part of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone can see how what they are working on contributes to the overall goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No chaos. No confusion. No excuses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone aligned. Everyone motivated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPI is an abbreviation for Key Performance Indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPIs measure the performance of an element or an activity over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPIs are usually tracked over several months or years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some common examples of KPIs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Revenue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Website visitors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sales conversion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employee satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employee turnover&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer net promoter score&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Current asset ratio&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Debt to equity ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPIs are often reported on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_scorecard&quot; title=&quot;Balanced Scorecard&quot;&gt;balanced scorecard&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure the organization is taking a balanced approach to measuring performance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/balanced-scorecard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;balanced scorecard 9 quadrants&quot; title=&quot;balanced scorecard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-an-okr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what is an OKR?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKR is an abbreviation for objectives and key results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OKR methodology was created by Intel’s founder, Andy Grove, and since brought to fame by &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;John Doerr&lt;/a&gt; and the founders of Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs are brilliant for strategy execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectives clearly state what you want to achieve. They are aspirational and qualitative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Results measure outcomes. They are tangible and quantitative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs usually have a lifetime of one quarter, with weekly check-ins on progress during the quarter. Early-stage companies may choose to run OKRs monthly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okrs-vs-kpis---what-is-the-difference&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OKRs vs KPIs - what is the difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have a KPI that measures revenue-per-month. Let’s say your revenue is currently $10m/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a strategic planning session, you set a one-year goal to double revenue to $20m/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goal setting is easy. Execution is where the going gets tough and value is created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your $20m/month strategic goal in mind, you can now set your objectives for the next quarter. This may take some research, brainstorming and workshops. Let’s say at the conclusion of these planning activities, you agree on one objective to rally behind for the next quarter, to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;solve how to make our baby pram products smart-prams that Australian parents will love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key results measure the outcome of your objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key results provide clarity on how you will evaluate whether or not the &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; has been achieved. Google is famous for making their post-quarter reviews of OKRs binary, asking themselves:&lt;br /&gt;
“&lt;em&gt;Did we achieve the objective, yes or no?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, let’s say you set the following &lt;em&gt;key results&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200,000 downloads of our design brochure to unique IP addresses in Australia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50,000 Australian based parents sign up to receive our pre-launch offer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now your team will have a clear focus and common understanding of expectations for the next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lifespan-and-impact-of-okrs-vs-kpis&quot;&gt;lifespan and impact of OKRs vs KPIs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst your KPIs may run for several months or years, OKRs drive strategy execution for the current quarter - aligning the energy, creativity, intellect and hard work of everyone in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategy execution through OKRs may impact several KPIs of the organization, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Revenue per Month - moving towards our strategic goal to double revenue to $20m/month within one year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Number of Pre-Orders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employee Satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brand Awareness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why it is acceptable to have manual updating of actuals for OKRs. OKRs usually have a lifetime of one quarter, so automation is less important. In fact, many OKR thought leaders and consultants say that having OKR owners update the progress and actuals on their OKRs each week, is a discipline that positively impacts performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst most organizations will only set 1 to 5 OKRs for a quarter (which you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/how-many-OKRs/&quot; title=&quot;how many OKRs&quot;&gt;read about here&lt;/a&gt;), there are likely to be a hundred or more KPIs that get tracked for several months or years. For this reason we are now seeing some brilliant innovations in BI tools that can pull live KPI data from several different systems, into custom reports with configurable alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okrs-vs-kpis---why-does-it-matter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OKRs vs KPIs - why does it matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One great advantage of the OKR methodology is that it fuels creativity, risk taking, rapid learning and ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most practitioners, including the father of OKRs, Intel’s Andy Grove, and the pioneers since, firmly believe that remuneration should be decoupled from OKRs. At #stratapp, we share the same view. You want people to take risks and to strive for objectives that are ambitious and motivating. That’s how you transform organizations, create new markets and innovate beyond what competitors believe is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decoupling-okrs-from-remuneration&quot;&gt;decoupling OKRs from remuneration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t want OKRs to get caught up in the typical scenario that happens with KPIs. For example, the:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CEO and Sales Director meet to agree sales targets and a bonus plan for next year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sales Director thinks they can do $50-60m revenue, so he opens by suggesting a target of $30m&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CEO proposes a 2.5% bonus on revenue for the Sales Director, on sales achieved above $30m&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sales Director negotiates that threshold down to $20m, and wrangles in an extra bonus of another 2.5% if the sales exceed $40m (a target 33% below what he is privately aiming for)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That gets documented and the game continues, year on year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, you don’t want that age-old human dynamic taking place every quarter on OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want people to dream, be creative and really strive to take the organization to new levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t hit every key result, the collective impact of rallying everyone behind quarterly OKRs will move the organization forward on strategy execution like never before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-from-vivino-on-reviewing-okrs&quot;&gt;learning from Vivino on reviewing OKRs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, in designing the OKR module for #stratapp, we have applied a learning from the founder of Vivino (short video &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/xaH2tMQzyjA&quot; title=&quot;Vivino's founder on OKRs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). That is, in #stratapp, when you review your OKRs during and at the end of the OKR period, you can assign a simple ‘smiley face’ outcome for the review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;happy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;neutral&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the team leaders and executives get to apply some judgement, alongside the Google-style binary assessment of whether or not the OKR was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, even if we are behind on several key results sitting below an objective, we may be very happy with where we have landed overall in relation to that objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This functionality, and how you apply it, is a key ingredient to building culture and making sure your objectives are ambitious and motivating each quarter. In #stratapp, we recommend making these ‘smiley face’ reviews part of your weekly and monthly check-ins with the OKR owners and their teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We admire the real world explanation &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/xaH2tMQzyjA&quot; title=&quot;Vivino's founder on OKRs&quot;&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt; by Vivino’s founder, Heini Zachariassen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For less than 100 employees, we recommend no more than 1 or 2 OKR objectives per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each grouping of 500 employees above that, we recommend 2 to 4 OKR objectives per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rolling-out-okrs-org-wide&quot;&gt;rolling out OKRs org-wide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide to rollout OKRs to every employee, you can do that easily in #stratapp because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKRs can be organized around your org design - then filtered by org design, your teams, you and status&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Key Results can be cascaded down to multiple levels, with the progress automatically rolling up to calculate the progress at each level&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKRs can align to any level of your strategy tree, or be standalone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKR execution takes place in the same workspace - so you can get it done and leaders can support their teams with encouragement, feedback and removing blockers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you do this, please read &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/top-5-don'ts-on-OKRs/&quot; title=&quot;top 5 don'ts on OKRs&quot;&gt;top 5 don’ts on OKRs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs are about focusing your resources on objectives that are ambitious and inspiring. Objectives that your people and teams can rally behind, in a way that captures their imagination on what might be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than running 10 or 20 projects concurrently, the OKR philosophy is to channel your valuable time, energy, creativity, intellect and hard work into just 1 or 2 things that really matter. Doing this aligns everybody and it should create a massive positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fuel a thriving culture of creativity, risk taking and open collaboration, best practice is to completely decouple OKRs from employee remuneration (which we talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/OKRs-vs-KPIs/&quot; title=&quot;decoupling OKRs from remuneration&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst you may have many KPIs, less is more when it comes to OKRs (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/OKRs-vs-KPIs/&quot; title=&quot;OKRs vs KPIs&quot;&gt;OKRs vs KPIs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-many-key-results-per-okr&quot;&gt;how many key results per OKR?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most OKR objectives can be measured with 2 to 3 key results per objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In #stratapp, you can cascade key results below each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, we recommend stopping at two levels of key results below each objective. In most cases, one level of key results will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ownership-of-okrs&quot;&gt;ownership of OKRs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can assign different owners to objectives and their cascading key results in #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add members and guest users to each objective and key result card; of course, guest users can only see the cards they have been added to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is powered by org design, so you can add org design attributes to each objective and key result. This allows you to filter the OKR dashboard by org design - so you can quickly view the progress of the company, your teams and the OKRs you own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp powered by org design also means the app can seamlessly scale with clients from 5 to 500,000 employees.  You don’t have to remember people’s names in order to collaborate with them, and to make sure that they’re not left out or behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;confidentiality-on-okrs&quot;&gt;confidentiality on OKRs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best practice is to run your OKR program transparently, company-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp makes this easy, but you can also control who can see what if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, the 4 levels of security inside #stratapp, also apply to our OKR module.  That is, the creator/assignor/owner of each objective or key result can select 1 of 4 levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;restricted &lt;em&gt;- visible org-wide, anyone can contribute to the right-hand-side social section on each card&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;confidential &lt;em&gt;- visible to members only, members can invite members&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;secret &lt;em&gt;- visible to members only, only the owner can invite members&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;top secret &lt;em&gt;- same as secret, guest users cannot be invited&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;progressive-rollouts-of-okrs&quot;&gt;progressive rollouts of OKRs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp also allows you to rollout your OKR implementation progressively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you might want to share all or part of the strategy tree, but for the first two quarters keep the OKR rollout limited to the top 3 levels of management - until you get a better feel for the methodology and how best to apply it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again the power of having org design built into #stratapp comes into play.  You can easily turn on/off the different modules of #stratapp, selecting who can see what based on your org design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, most clients start with social and work collaboration, then add ideation, the strategy tree and OKRs, then the “our why” and “direction” pages under strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/7-steps-to-successfully-implement-OKRs/&quot; title=&quot;implement OKRs in 7 steps&quot;&gt;how to successfully implement OKRs in 7 steps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>_people/ash-richardson.md</name></author><category term="[&quot;#okr&quot;]" /><summary type="html">how many OKR objectives?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">7 steps to successfully implement OKRs</title><link href="https://stratappsaas.com/blog/7-steps-to-successfully-implement-OKRs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="7 steps to successfully implement OKRs" /><published>2020-11-16T22:02:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-16T22:02:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stratappsaas.com/blog/7%20steps%20to%20successfully%20implement%20OKRs</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stratappsaas.com/blog/7-steps-to-successfully-implement-OKRs/">&lt;p&gt;If you hear this from a CEO or CxO role: “&lt;em&gt;Yes, our employees are doing OKRs&lt;/em&gt;”, you might want to short-the-stock as their OKR implementation will most likely fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs are brilliant for strategy execution.  However, to be successful you need to start your OKR implementation with the CEO and leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, OKRs are not the best starting point.  Before adopting OKRs, you first need to make sure your leadership team is aligned on and evolving the &lt;em&gt;strategy tree&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implement-okrs---the-strategy-tree&quot;&gt;implement OKRs - the strategy tree&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best practice is to align your OKRs to the strategy tree, per this extract from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-the-leadership-cycle&quot; title=&quot;the leadership cycle&quot;&gt;the leadership cycle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/strategy-tree-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp allows the flexibility to hang OKRs off any level in the strategy tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/best-OKR-software-app/&quot; title=&quot;best OKR software app&quot;&gt;best OKR software app in the world right now&lt;/a&gt;, bringing &lt;em&gt;strategy + OKRs + execution&lt;/em&gt; into one seamless digital workspace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/strategy-okrs-execution.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, as good as they are, not all of your strategy execution needs to be done through OKRs.  #stratapp has been designed with this real-world insight front of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, you can execute strategy in a way that best suits your business.  You don’t have to change your business to suit the app.  This makes your time-to-value on #stratapp just days, rather than months or quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is powered by @org-design, so it works seamlessly for 5 to 500,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1---start-with-the-strategy-tree&quot;&gt;step #1 - start with the strategy tree&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step #1 is to start with the strategy tree and the leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define &lt;em&gt;the leadership team&lt;/em&gt; as the top 10 to 15 in the organization - fewer for smaller companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with the strategy tree and the leadership team because &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-engaging-people&quot; title=&quot;engaging people&quot;&gt;most leaders know where they are heading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;strategy execution rarely meets expectations&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2---evolve-the-strategy-tree-be-agile&quot;&gt;step #2 - evolve the strategy tree, be agile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need the strategy tree to be perfect.  You just need to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step #2 is to switch from static strategy documents, spreadsheets, email and chat groups, to collaborating in real-time off the strategy tree.  Collaboration without chaos.  Collaboration with context and structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the leadership team master this, you are then ready to move onto OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;okrs-are-brilliant---but-you-wont-stop-doing-strategy&quot;&gt;OKRs are brilliant - but you won’t stop doing strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makes sense right?  Whilst OKRs drive strategy execution for the next month or quarter, you are still evolving your strategy for the next 12 to 36 months, right?  Of course you are, as you should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This real-world attribute fundamentally sets #stratapp apart from the plethora of single-use-OKR-apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The strategy tree is alive and interactive, and is powered by the &lt;em&gt;6 elements of collaboration*&lt;/em&gt;.  You can continue to evolve the strategy without losing alignment and engagement at all levels of the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Execution of the OKRs takes place in the same digital workspace.  OKRs are not just a pretty dashboard of targets and roll-up calculations to track people.  OKR execution is actually taking place inside #stratapp, also powered by the &lt;em&gt;6 elements of collaboration&lt;/em&gt;.  This rapidly elevates performance and culture, not to mention sustaining OKR adoption - empowering leaders at all levels with the opportunity to proactively lead, supporting their teams where it matters most.  You also see the rising stars, without the distortion of hierarchy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*The &lt;em&gt;6 elements of collaboration&lt;/em&gt; elegantly combined into &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;social with structure &amp;amp; context&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;live meeting notes, files &amp;amp; links&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ideas &amp;amp; challenges for crowdsourcing innovation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;initiative/project workboards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sub-tasks, tasks &amp;amp; personal workspace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;risk management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3---workshop-a---one-digital-workspace&quot;&gt;step #3 - Workshop A - one digital workspace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this 60min hands-on Workshop A, you aim to have the leadership team comfortable with working in &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt; with respect to strategy, which means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creating and evolving the strategy tree (remembering step #2)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;powering the strategy tree with &lt;em&gt;6 elements of collaboration&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;understanding security/confidentiality and how to leverage @org-design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;running meetings and meeting actions - with context and structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like learning a new language or preparing for a big sporting event, the leadership team then jump in and commit to doing this daily for the 7-21 days following Workshop A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, at this step #3 we still have the OKRs module in #stratapp turned off, so there is no problem adding other people from outside of the leadership team to collaborate on meetings/tasks/initiatives and the strategy tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4---workshop-b---big-bang-value&quot;&gt;step #4 - Workshop B - big bang value&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 7-21 days mastering &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt;, your leadership team will start to see several new opportunities for big bang value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step #4 is to embrace these insights by running an expansive Workshop B to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shape those ideas and opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share global best practices (we, or our partners, aim to add value here without compromising the confidentiality or IP of other clients)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop B aligns the leadership team on evolving their &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt;.  Thus providing clarity and consensus, before moving onto the next phase of adding the OKR methodology and cascading OKRs org-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implement-okrs---regrouping&quot;&gt;implement OKRs - regrouping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With solid alignment of the leadership team and real-time collaboration in &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt;, your organization is now ready to embrace the brilliant OKR methodology for strategy execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you conclude that alignment and real-time collaboration has not yet been achieved, you may decide to regroup and apply one or both of these strategy pages inside #stratapp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our why - &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/how-great-leaders-inspire-action-by-simon-sinek/&quot; title=&quot;Simon Sinek&quot;&gt;Simon Sinek’s&lt;/a&gt; framework for establishing a solid belief foundation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;direction - &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/professor-roger-martin-on-what-ceos-should-really-be-doing/&quot; title=&quot;Professor Roger Martin&quot;&gt;Professor Roger Martin’s&lt;/a&gt; framework for setting a direction, so that the leadership team and management can shape the strategy tree and strategy execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In #stratapp, you can turn pages on/off by team or individual - you don’t have to change your business to suit the app - so you don’t have to apply these “our why” and “direction” pages as part of regrouping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach to achieving alignment is up to you, as you know what will work best for your leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implement-okrs---run-the-first-period-with-the-leadership-team-only&quot;&gt;implement OKRs - run the first period with the leadership team only&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although OKRs are all about &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-engaging-people&quot; title=&quot;engaging people&quot;&gt;engaging everyone&lt;/a&gt;, success starts at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, starting with the leadership team is the primary focus of steps 1 to 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-5---start-with-the-leadership-team&quot;&gt;step #5 - start with the leadership team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the leadership team now aligned on the strategy tree and thriving together in &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt;, the next step is to agree OKRs for the first period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most organizations opt for a quarterly OKR cycle, however early-stage companies may prefer monthly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your first OKR period, we recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting with no more than 2x OKRs and 2-4x key results per OKR&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allocating ownership of each objective and key result to different members of the leadership team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding all leadership team members on each objective and key result card - you won’t do this later, but for this first OKR period it is important&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keeping the security level on each to the lowest level, where you’re able to do so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each objective and key result card will then be powered by the &lt;em&gt;6 elements of collaboration&lt;/em&gt; in #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may involve adding employees who are outside of the leadership team.  As mentioned above, you can collaborate effectively without yet publishing the OKR module outside of the leadership team.  This is another real-world attribute of #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-many-okrs&quot;&gt;how many OKRs?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many OKRs should we set each month or quarter?  Less is more, as explained &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/how-many-OKRs/&quot; title=&quot;how many OKRs?&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also want to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/top-5-don'ts-on-OKRs/&quot; title=&quot;top 5 don'ts on OKRs&quot;&gt;top 5 don’ts on OKRs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implement-okrs---progressively&quot;&gt;implement OKRs - progressively&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick here is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to announce you are “&lt;em&gt;rolling out OKRs&lt;/em&gt;”, as that tends to create a mixed reaction from employees.  Most people who are new to OKRs misunderstand the methodology and why it is so brilliant for the organization, and for them as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend you go for an approach that is less threatening and more aspirational:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;our leadership team have recently been working together in one digital workspace for ideation + planning + strategy + execution, and now we want to progressively open that up to the whole company, so we can evolve these together with you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you add employees at each stage of the rollout, you may decide to share these two presentations: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-engaging-people&quot; title=&quot;engaging people&quot;&gt;engaging people&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-the-leadership-cycle&quot; title=&quot;the leadership cycle&quot;&gt;the leadership cycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-6---cascading-one-digital-workspace&quot;&gt;step #6 - cascading one digital workspace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend cascading your rollout of the &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt; in 5 stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rollout stage 1 - leadership team - top 10 to 15 people (fewer for small companies)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rollout stage 2 - expand to 25 (count includes the leadership team)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rollout stage 3 - expand to 50&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rollout stage 4 - expand to 250&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rollout stage 5 - org-wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend allowing 2 to 3 weeks in between each rollout stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At each rollout stage you turn on the ideation, OKR and strategy modules.  For people you add before their rollout stage, you would typically limit their access to social and workspace - which in themselves are a game changer for elevating culture, collaboration and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This progressive rollout approach solves three aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leaders at each level in the organization get to lead by example - not just at the easy beginning, but all of the way through to successful adoption and having a positive impact on strategy execution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Context, collaboration and cadence improves progressively - learning as you go&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When employees are added, there is “&lt;em&gt;movement at the station&lt;/em&gt;” - an old saying from Australian sheep and cattle farmers - that is, a reason to be there and engage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-7---okr-consultants-skilled-in-change&quot;&gt;step #7 - OKR consultants skilled in change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cascading OKRs, most larger companies will hire an OKR coach who has a background in change management consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel that’s the right choice for your organization, we recommend engaging the consultant just before rollout stage 3; of the 5 rollout stages listed at step #6 above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stages 1 and 2 beforehand will give you great insight to the challenges you may or may not be facing, and the profile of consultant you need to hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implement-okrs---remuneration&quot;&gt;implement OKRs - remuneration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most practitioners, including the father of OKRs, Intel’s Andy Grove, and the pioneers since, firmly believe that remuneration should be decoupled from OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At #stratapp, we share the same view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want people to take risks and to strive for objectives that are ambitious and motivating. That’s how you transform organizations, create new markets and innovate beyond what competitors believe is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discuss this further in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/OKRs-vs-KPIs/&quot; title=&quot;OKRs vs KPIs&quot;&gt;the difference between OKRs vs KPIs vs remuneration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
