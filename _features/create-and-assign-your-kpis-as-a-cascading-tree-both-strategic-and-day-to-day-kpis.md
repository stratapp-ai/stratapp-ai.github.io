KPIs/OKRs can be strategic or day to day, quantitative or qualitative.  KPIs/OKRs can be viewed as their own hierarchical tree (which automatically overlay onto a Live Org Chart), indented list or balanced scorecard.

Most importantly, KPIs/OKRs can be applied to any module inside #stratapp.  That is, you do not have to adjust or change how your organization manages performance today.

If you walk into your company canteen or lunch area today and ask:

“Please raise your hand if within 1-click on your mobile you can show me your personal KPIs/OKRs, how they are tracking and where they fit in with the organization overall.”

How many hands in your organization would go up?  With #stratapp, every employee can.
