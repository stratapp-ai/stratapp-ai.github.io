Success on strategy executions requires us to balance strategy execution with daily work. #stratapp solves this balance in one seamless digital workspace.

OKRs, brought to fame by John Doerr and the founders of Google, are brilliant for driving strategy execution.

In #stratapp, OKRs become a natural part of each day, because they are part of the same digital workspace. You donâ€™t have to open another single-use-app to update them.

You can cascade the OKR hierarchy, separate to the strategy tree hierarchy.  As beautifully articulated by [Richard Rumelt in Good Strategy Bad Strategy](https://stratappsaas.com/good-strategy-bad-strategy-by-richard-rumelt/ "Good Strategy Bad Strategy"){:target="_blank"}, setting targets is not a strategy.

The strategy tree reflects your strategy.  OKRs drive execution.
