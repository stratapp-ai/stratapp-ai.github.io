slug: social with 10x impact

There are so many great case studies on the positive impact for employee engagement, when CEOs and senior leaders drop into social conversations to offer encouragement, support and recognition.  

A CEO offering such at the watercooler, will often see the ‘Chinese Whispers’ effect as their well intended meaning passes from person to person inside the organization.

With org-wide social, the CEO’s contribution is authentic, immediate and undiluted - and viral as employees at all levels engage with the CEO.
