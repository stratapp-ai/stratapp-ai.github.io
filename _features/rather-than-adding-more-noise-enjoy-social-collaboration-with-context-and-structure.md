Social apps without context or structure, just add more noise. Especially as you move above 50 employees into mid-market and corporates. Social fast becomes a twitter-style fire hose of notifications, or like being on the end of hundreds of reply-all emails per day.

\#stratapp has found a way to embrace the power of social - but with context and structure.

In #stratapp, most social interaction takes place within either the strategic plan or KPI hierarchy, or the individual cards for notes, tasks, risks, ideas and challenges. This naturally organizes what conversations relate to what, and why - in doing so, it kills about 90% of internal email.

With #stratapp, social has structure. We were inspired by the early innovations of Stride, since acquired then buried by #slack. We’ve ratcheted the innovations of Stride up a notch. When you post or reply inside #stratapp, you can tag it as a comment, agree, disagree, question, task, risk, idea, decision, approval or something to note.

You’ve probably already figured out why. Not everyone in a 50, 500, 5,000 or 50,000 employee organization wants to sift through hundreds of social notifications to find exactly what they need to know. People also don’t want to open and browse each module individually (e.g. strategy, KPIs, risks, ideas and workboards).

So, we have extracted all social to one place. You can immediately get to exactly what you are interested in. For example, “I want to see any questions, decisions or approvals made in the last 72hrs on anything to do with our strategy.” That takes 4-5 seconds to do inside #stratapp. Of course, what you can see is subject to security settings.

The same goes for workboards. Whilst there might be 25 users busy and deeply engaged on a project workboard, you may not want to scroll through hundreds of notifications to keep track. Workboards in #stratapp have their own dedicated social page, where you can quickly filter to what you are interested in, for example, “I want to see any ideas, risks or questions asked on a task where I am a member of that task card.”

Recapping, #stratapp’s social has:

* Context - naturally organizing conversations where they belong
* Structure - so you can find exactly what you are interested in
* Filtering - so you don’t need to go searching or scrolling to catch up
* Workboard social page - so you can easily keep up and engage with the project
* Security - protecting the organization’s IP and who can see what

\#stratapp’s social frees your time and headspace, with a laser focus on what really matters.
