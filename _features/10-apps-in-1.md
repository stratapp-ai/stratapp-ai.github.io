Up until about 2010, there was an enthusiastic rush to add as many consumer apps to your smartphone as possible. At almost every pub or restaurant gathering you’d hear someone say: “_So, what cool new apps have you discovered this week?_”

A similar explosion of choice happened with enterprise software, fuelled on by the niche focus of venture capital and group think.

Now, as we approach 2020, for both consumer and enterprise the trend is reversing. Consumers are organizing their smartphones around the apps they really need, and companies are trying to rationalize proliferation. Companies don’t want to send employees to 10+ different apps in order to do their jobs.

In the small business segment, a great example of a consolidated SaaS approach is the impressive product [https://keap.com/keap](https://keap.com/keap "https://keap.com/keap"){:target="_blank"} - covering the whole cycle from managing leads, to doing the work, getting paid and staying connected, all in one app.

Predicting this reversal some years ago, the founders of #stratapp planned from the outset to roll 10-apps-into-1, as the starting point. To achieve this we had to create a UX design construct that is visually and interactively consistent across the whole application. We then took it to the next level - making the 10-apps-in-1 seamlessly interact with each other.
