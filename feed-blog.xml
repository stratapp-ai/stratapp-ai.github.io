        <title>make money referring</title>
        <subheading>we have a generous referral model and a plan to rewrite the SaaS playbook on sharing our success with those who help build the company</subheading>
        <category>#articles</category>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-i-refer-stratapp&quot;&gt;why should I refer #stratapp?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 reasons to refer #stratapp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;add value to others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;make money&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gain an edge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$US40,000 in referral fees equates to only 5 clients of 1,200 users each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not many, when you think about how many people you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have one referrer in Virginia USA who, in the last month, has introduced 14x potential clients ranging from 20 to 60,000 employees, and totalling over 500,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-are-the-ideal-clients&quot;&gt;who are the ideal clients?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is sector, geography, culture and size agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp suits most organizations, from 5 to 500,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can refer #stratapp into any level of a potential client - team member, team leader, manager, senior manager, executive or business owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not have to be a CxO role or business owner, although these roles have the most influence and will join the dots on the competitive advantage and business valuation potential of #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-referral-model&quot;&gt;what is the referral model?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offer 2 types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;referral partner&lt;/strong&gt; (which can be anyone, including employees of clients) - 10% of SaaS fees for the first 18 months on clients they referrer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;business partner&lt;/strong&gt; (by invitation) - 10% of SaaS fees for life, plus 10% for life from the clients of other business partners they introduce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also working on an &lt;strong&gt;equity partner&lt;/strong&gt; model, which you can read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/make-money-referring-stratapp&quot; title=&quot;make money referring #stratapp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-referral-process&quot;&gt;what is the referral process?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We keep it simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;register&lt;/strong&gt; the potential client - by emailing sales@stratapp.ai, so we can first check the potential client does not already belong to another referrer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;introduce&lt;/strong&gt; the potential client&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;receive&lt;/strong&gt; % of SaaS fees - paid to you quarterly, when the client reaches 20 or more paid users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-learn-more&quot;&gt;how can I learn more?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a short deck on how to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/make-money-referring-stratapp&quot; title=&quot;make money referring #stratapp&quot;&gt;make money referring #stratapp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-i-share-with-potential-clients&quot;&gt;what can I share with potential clients?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may share these &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.stratapp.ai/portal/kb/articles/useful-links&quot; title=&quot;useful links&quot;&gt;useful links&lt;/a&gt; with potential clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you&quot;&gt;thank you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read about our referral model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can think of others who may benefit from making some extra money, especially those working in B2B services (e.g. consultants, coaches, agencies and professional services), feel free to share this article with them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Atlassian thought of it, #stratapp’s done it - social with structure</title>
        <subheading>Those of you into B2B SaaS will remember Stride, a clever innovation by Atlassian that had a huge waiting list for Beta, then it was buried by #slack.</subheading>
        <category>#articles</category>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Without structure, social collaboration can quickly become a fire-hose of noise and distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strides-big-idea&quot;&gt;Stride’s Big Idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help solve this, Atlassian thought of a clever idea to add structure to social. When you posted something in Stride by Atlassian, you could tag the post as a:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Action&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about that for a moment. Not only are you making life easier for your recipients, it enables you to go back to filter on your own posts. For example, “what was that decision I made for Tom last week?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stride also added new innovations on profile status. Stride encouraged users to take “zone time” to think, research, be creative and get high-value work done. How’s that, a social app making it easier for you to avoid getting caught in the productivity killer trap of always being livechat accessible to your boss and colleagues? Admirable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;slack-buries-stride&quot;&gt;#slack Buries Stride&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stride was released in Sep 2017. After only 9 months, Stride was acquired by #slack in Jul 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after that, #slack filed for their IPO on the US stock exchange in Apr 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a ground swell of excitement globally on Atlassian’s innovation to add structure to social. That was probably not great timing for #slack, leading up to their IPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After acquiring Stride, #slack buried it. Goneski! [apologies for the Australian / New Zealand slang]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stratapp-goes-next-level&quot;&gt;#stratapp Goes Next Level&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran workshops on this social-with-structure idea with business owners, CEOs, executives, mid-level managers, team leaders and frontline employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We concluded 3 things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 tags will cover 90% of scenarios&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We should add the ability to post or request&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The same structure could apply to all card types and workboards, not only social messaging and groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-post&quot;&gt;Social Post&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the 10 tags inside a #stratapp social post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/social post.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-request&quot;&gt;Social Request&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the 3 tags inside a #stratapp social request:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/social request.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;filters&quot;&gt;Filters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp has powerful filters for all users across the whole app, not only on social messaging and groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine being able to find out the following 3 things in less than 5 seconds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example #1&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve been away for 72 hours. What strategy related questions have been asked, and what decisions or approvals have been made, whilst I was away? Great, now let’s narrow that down further to only the strategy aspects I own or am directly involved in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example #2&lt;br /&gt;
For the risks, ideas and challenges I currently own, what is the status of tasks I have assigned to others?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example #3&lt;br /&gt;
Who is having the most influence on strategy or KPI related work? Who are the emerging team players on KPIs? Who are the emerging innovators on strategy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;zone-time&quot;&gt;Zone Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not forget that other Atlassian innovation in Stride regards the user’s profile status (described as “zone time” in the opening paragraphs above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp has expanded further on that innovation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/profile status.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whiteboard-video&quot;&gt;Whiteboard Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s me on a whiteboard explaining &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zcbhwHhtbMw&quot; title=&quot;social with structure&quot;&gt;how and why we applied structure to social&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup tech founders don’t tend to do this, but you’ll see in that video, just like in this article, I give full credit to the original thinking and innovation from the talented folks at Atlassian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you&quot;&gt;Thank You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading (and hopefully sharing).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>a consulting goldmine</title>
        <subheading>#stratapp creates a win:win:win for clients, consultants and #stratapp</subheading>
        <category>#articles</category>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;why?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know what’s going on, at all levels in the client’s organization, you can add more value.  Not only that, the client’s CEO and leadership team have a tangible context for considering your ideas and proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;consulting-sales-today&quot;&gt;consulting sales today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consulting sales today are highly dependent on a few key relationships.  By investing thoughtful effort into time consuming lunches, dinners and workshops, consultants try to understand and define &lt;em&gt;the problem&lt;/em&gt;, before scoping out potential ways to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visibility is subjective, and limited to these key relationships&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deliverables are point-in-time static documents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consultants get (partly) blamed for subsequent poor execution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Onselling additional work takes a lot of time and effort, and some luck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;consulting-sales-in-future&quot;&gt;consulting sales in future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp changes the game on how consulting work gets identified, scoped, sold and delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How?  #stratapp provides more client insights than any other tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See everything objectively, at all levels in real time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deliver work in a way that is alive and interactive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Derisk your work, by proactively assisting on blockers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Onsell with real data, genuine insights and aligned interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, what the consultant can see and edit inside #stratapp is controlled by the client, ensuring a win:win:win relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-insights-than-any-other-tech&quot;&gt;more insights than any other tech&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you could see, in just a few seconds, the exact status and underlying cadence of the client’s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strategy execution across: goals -&amp;gt; sub-goals -&amp;gt; actions -&amp;gt; projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;OKRs - balancing strategy execution with daily work&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;live dashboards&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;risks/mitigations/assumptions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;projects/tasks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;challenges/ideas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;meetings/actions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;employee sentiment and engagement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;team players/innovators/rising stars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;interactive global heatmap, showing what’s hot right now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/alignment-jpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;go-deeper&quot;&gt;go deeper&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine filtering by unlimited combinations of geography, levels, functions, verticals and horizontals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This level of real time alignment and insight is unprecedented in B2B tech - giving progressive CEOs, leaders, employees and consultants unlimited opportunities to innovate strategy execution and day to day work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;consulting-deliverables-no-more-static-docs&quot;&gt;consulting deliverables (no more static docs)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old school consulting deliverables, in the form of point-in-time static docs, are time consuming, hugely unproductive, ‘top down’ by nature and fast out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One-off project management software doesn’t help either.  It is expensive, complex to use and understood by less than 5% of employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustaining strategy execution, business transformation and culture elevation requires a fresh new approach and genuine org-wide engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With #stratapp, consultants instantly create a digital workspace to collaborate and execute live, together with their clients.  A digital workspace that is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;agile&lt;/strong&gt; - alive and interactive, evolving as the execution provides more insights&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inclusive&lt;/strong&gt; - a user experience and price price that achieves org-wide engagement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easy&lt;/strong&gt; - naturally intuitive, making the time to value of minutes, not weeks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lasting&lt;/strong&gt; - adds value to the client beyond the life of the consulting engagement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;efficient&lt;/strong&gt; - helps CTOs to eliminate single-purpose-apps and integrations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;multi-dimensional&lt;/strong&gt; - helps every employee execute both strategic and day to day work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;next Gen ready&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/radical-transparency/&quot; title=&quot;millennials&quot;&gt;millennials&lt;/a&gt; will be 75% of the workforce by 2025&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>learning from Accenture on growing consulting revenue</title>
        <subheading>how to drive tier-2 and niche firm consulting revenue growth in 2021</subheading>
        <category>#articles</category>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-from-accenture&quot;&gt;learning from Accenture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nearly joined McKinsey, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;loved my time at Accenture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and over the years enjoyed great experiences with folks from McKinsey, Bain, BCG, KPMG and Deloitte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my take on how the market leader, Accenture, achieved outstanding growth these last 30 years, and how &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tier-2 and niche consulting firms of 200 to 20,000 headcount&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can grow revenue in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accentures-early-growth&quot;&gt;Accenture’s early growth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-pillars&quot;&gt;two pillars&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accenture’s market leading growth to 33,000 employees by 1995 was driven on two pillars: &lt;em&gt;global systemisation of every aspect of the business&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;supporting clients looking to adopt new technology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sustain that growth, Accenture learnt how to assimilate experienced hires into manager and partner roles (fortunate for me), as it was going to be too slow to only promote talent from within.  This was a significant culture pivot that created a whole range of new challenges, which Accenture overcame, fast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rebranding&quot;&gt;rebranding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in 1997 came the difficult split from Arthur Andersen, resolved by arbitration in 2000, the year Andersen Consulting rebranded to Accenture - a name chosen by &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/TwLYQuZRLoI&quot; title=&quot;crowdsourcing ideas from employees&quot;&gt;crowdsourcing ideas from employees&lt;/a&gt;, with the winner a Norwegian employee, Kim Petersen, who conceived Accenture from “accent on the future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30 years later we see technology and ingenuity at the heart of the brand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/accenture-purpose-jpeg.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.accenture.com/au-en/about/company-index&quot; title=&quot;https://www.accenture.com/au-en/about/company-index&quot;&gt;https://www.accenture.com/au-en/about/company-index&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restructuring&quot;&gt;restructuring&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time the firm responded rapidly to a global market expectation for consultants (and investment bankers) to genuinely understand the industries they are advising - rather than charging premium fees to learn on the job whilst applying a generic tool kit of skills across strategy, process, change and tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the tier-1 firms this market expectation gave birth to a matrix org design of market verticals and skills-based horizontals.  The speed, scope and thoroughness of execution at Accenture was breath-taking.  I learnt heaps, but that was just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accentures-rapid-expansion&quot;&gt;Accenture’s rapid expansion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the year 2000 it only took 15 years to grow to a staggering 358,000 employees and US$31bn revenue; now ~505k employees and ~$50bn revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst Accenture has continued to support clients on adopting new technology, this 10-fold growth came mostly from partnering with clients on operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, rather than only pursuing one-off consulting projects on improving the client’s business, from the mid-90s Accenture pitched to run part of the client’s business.  Enter, recurring revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an early pioneer of large scale &lt;em&gt;business process management&lt;/em&gt;, Accenture’s approach to the client relationship was sophisticated and founded on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accenture continuing to apply world’s best practice to improve the client’s outcomes, often against a comprehensive baseline that was agreed with the client upfront&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sharing the commercial risks, investments (time, money and/or resources) and upsides&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long term deals that embraced a collaborative mindset as business partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;adversity&quot;&gt;adversity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the face of COVID-19 and global upheaval, Accenture has continued to grow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/accenture-performance-q1fy2021.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.accenture.com/earnings-infographics/&quot; title=&quot;https://newsroom.accenture.com/earnings-infographics/&quot;&gt;https://newsroom.accenture.com/earnings-infographics/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accentures-strategic-advantages&quot;&gt;Accenture’s strategic advantages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;run part of the client’s business&lt;/em&gt; deals have more expensive sales cycles and lower margins than consulting, four strategic advantages have emerged for Accenture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;One deal leads to more deals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; per client (e.g. start by running “accounts receivable” within the finance function, and end up running most of finance, ITC, call centres and supply chain operations, thereby freeing the client to focus on strategy, marketing, R&amp;amp;D and customer experience)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most deals lead to more&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (non-competitive) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;consulting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deep technology and process insights in one sector, help to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;win more deals globally in that sector&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proven stars from running operations on one deal become a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;valuable source of talent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for winning, running and improving &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;other deals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe most tier-2 and niche consulting firms of 200 to 20,000 employees can apply some of these insights to proactively create new opportunities for growth in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-tier-2-and-niche-firms-do&quot;&gt;what can tier-2 and niche firms do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2021-growth-opportunity-1---saas-technologies&quot;&gt;2021 growth opportunity #1 - SaaS technologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SaaS, meaning &lt;em&gt;software as a service&lt;/em&gt;, is a way of delivering applications over the internet.  Customers don’t have to buy/install/maintain/update hardware or software themselves.  All they need is an internet connection.  Customers usually pay per user and/or on a usage basis, with unit prices reducing on volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tier-2 and niche consulting firms often underestimate the revenue potential of supporting clients on how they choose, adopt, rollout and evolve SaaS.  Not to mention the almost unlimited consulting revenue potential from having a closer client relationship and a deeper understanding of the client’s day to day business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the latter is a key criteria for consulting firms to figure out which SaaS technologies to align with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pick-sector-agnostic-tech-that-is-easy-to-learn-and-generates-high-value-consulting&quot;&gt;pick sector-agnostic tech that is easy to learn and generates high-value consulting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from outsourcing and industry restructures, there is no better way to drive consulting revenue than assisting clients on their journey to &lt;em&gt;adopt and evolve new technology&lt;/em&gt;.  That strategy fuelled the first phase of Accenture’s market leading growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clients are increasingly time poor and unable to focus on getting real work done.  Client side leaders at all levels seem consumed in cultures of real-time messaging and 247 availability.  Many (perhaps most) have lost the time and ability to research, think deeply, plan carefully and execute at speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clients need help to adopt and evolve new technology.  Help they are willing to pay for to de-risk implementations and maximise ROI.  The consulting opportunities are broader than what you might think:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;high level planning &amp;amp; context validation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;change management &amp;amp; communications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;project management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;requirements gathering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;as-is &amp;amp; to-be mapping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;setting up the tech&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rollout planning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;onboarding the first phase of users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;supporting those users&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building a showcase of successes and learnings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building the capabilities to support and scale rollouts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;defining success metrics and target outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;managing rollouts progressively&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;measuring and learning from outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are my top-3 SaaS technology picks to build a consulting services offering around in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;a-saas-for-leading-a-company&quot;&gt;a) SaaS for leading a company&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one app that solves &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/the-leadership-cycle/&quot; title=&quot;the leadership cycle&quot;&gt;the leadership cycle&lt;/a&gt; in one digital workspace: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/&quot; title=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/&quot;&gt;https://stratappsaas.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst easy to learn, the product lends itself naturally to driving consulting revenue on both implementations and upselling additional consulting based on real-time insights on what is happening client side.  This creates a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-consulting-partners-win-win-win&quot; title=&quot;creating a win:win:win&quot;&gt;win:win:win&lt;/a&gt; for the client, consultant and #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;b-saas-for-employee-engagement&quot;&gt;b) SaaS for employee engagement&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as supporting mainstream HCM SaaS rollouts (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.workday.com/&quot; title=&quot;Workday&quot;&gt;Workday&lt;/a&gt;), you could look to support emerging tech in employee engagement and culture building, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultureamp.com/&quot; title=&quot;Culture Amp&quot;&gt;Culture Amp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.15five.com/&quot; title=&quot;15Five&quot;&gt;15Five&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;c-saas-for-crm&quot;&gt;c) SaaS for CRM&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, I can feel your eyes rolling at the mention of CRM, please bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the services market built around CRM is mature and competitive, there is still a massive problem for clients buying a new CRM: &lt;em&gt;failed implementations&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look under the bonnet at each product’s design, the top three CRMs (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/&quot; title=&quot;Salesforce&quot;&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dynamics.microsoft.com/&quot; title=&quot;Microsoft Dynamics&quot;&gt;Dynamics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zoho.com&quot; title=&quot;Zoho CRM&quot;&gt;Zoho&lt;/a&gt;) are remarkably similar.  Clients hire CRM implementation firms that have deep skills in configuring and integrating these products, from a technical perspective.  However, these firms are often weak at the broader thinking, validation and planning that clients need for their CRM implementation to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, most CRM implementations are considered a failure by clients - on value for money, timeframe blowouts, delivery expectations, end user adoption and dashboard data quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementation firms doing this work usually lack broader consulting skills like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;business strategy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;business and operating model design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;process mapping and design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;activity-based-costing and value creation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;org design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;risks and mitigations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;thinking through how the above may change next 3-5 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building leadership team and senior management consensus on above&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;change management and communications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;training planning and delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configuring and programming the CRM has become a commodity service that you can offshore, or price compete onshore, providing you manage the concept designs, validation and functional specs on behalf of the client.  You can help clients avoid paying overpriced onshore implementation costs for this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can join the dots on where to take this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pick-industry-or-function-specific-tech-that-is-easy-to-learn-and-generates-ongoing-consulting&quot;&gt;pick industry or function specific tech that is easy to learn and generates ongoing consulting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are unlimited opportunities here, so your criteria may come down to what interests your firm, industry knowledge and local market potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few &lt;em&gt;function specific tech&lt;/em&gt; examples to help get you started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel management (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.concur.com&quot; title=&quot;Concur&quot;&gt;Concur&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend management (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coupa.com/&quot; title=&quot;Coupa&quot;&gt;Coupa&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rostering (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deputy.com/&quot; title=&quot;Deputy&quot;&gt;Deputy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Safety (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://safetyculture.com/&quot; title=&quot;Safety Culture&quot;&gt;SafetyCulture&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industry specific tech&lt;/em&gt; is fast emerging in health (including medical practices and pharmacy), aged care, facilities/asset/fleet management, construction, real estate, aviation, hospitality and retail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2021-growth-opportunity-2---distributed-working&quot;&gt;2021 growth opportunity #2 - distributed working&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has brought to the mainstream what marketing, tech and product teams have known for about 10 years: &lt;em&gt;you can trust most people to work remotely and collaboration tech is way better than email.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remote and hybrid working&lt;/em&gt; implies you have an office to be remote from.  We’ve recently seen announcements from dozens of household brands saying they will now allow most, if not all employees, to work from home.  Those companies that are keeping an office will need to think through a whole range of factors, work that can be helped by consultants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;office design and ergonomics for frequent or infrequent visits by home-based workers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;org design (including adding offshore team members to onshore teams) and cadence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;team building, creativity and leadership&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;technology that allows you to lead a company from anywhere (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/&quot; title=&quot;#stratapp&quot;&gt;#stratapp&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;balancing strategy and day to day execution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hiring, induction, performance management, offboarding and alumni&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;security and OH&amp;amp;S&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Distributed working&lt;/em&gt; refers to no office at all.  That is, there is no office to be &lt;em&gt;remote&lt;/em&gt; from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Mullenweg, the founder of Wordpress.com, employs 1,200 people across 75 countries without an office.  Matt articulates five levels of autonomy in a brilliant interview with Sam Harris on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/The-New-Future-of-Work-a-Sam-Harris-podcast-interview-with-Matt-Mullenweg-on-distributed-working/&quot; title=&quot;The New Future of Work&quot;&gt;The New Future of Work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/distributed working levels -matt mullenweg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping clients on their journey to remote, hybrid and distributed working is a potential consulting goldmine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2021-growth-opportunity-3---niche-operations&quot;&gt;2021 growth opportunity #3 - niche operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than go after large-scale price-driven outsourcing deals, you could look for opportunities that allow you to niche on what you can do better than other providers, and the client doing it themselves internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that most of the top tier BPM firms now need to sell a minimum of 25 seats into a client to make the sales cycle and overheads worthwhile; their ideal minimum is 100 seats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can start at two seats to achieve the strategic advantages that emerged for Accenture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you only place two people into a client delivering on a niche part of their operations, you can then offer that service globally to other clients, thereby achieving scale and ROI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only will you achieve recurring revenue and a closer relationship with each client, you should then win more non-competitive consulting work and additional operations deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you&quot;&gt;thank you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading (and hopefully sharing), and thank you to Accenture for the wonderful memories, friendships and opportunities to learn and travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At #stratapp we are on a mission to &lt;em&gt;make leading a company easier and more inclusive&lt;/em&gt; - aligning and motivating everyone on what really matters - here is a quick video on how we do that: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/the-leadership-cycle/&quot; title=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/the-leadership-cycle/&quot;&gt;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/the-leadership-cycle/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>why we lump our CFOs with risk management</title>
        <subheading>If made easier, most of us would embrace risk management. But it’s not, so we pass the monkey to our CFOs. You know, that C-level role we love to delegate annoying things to.</subheading>
        <category>#articles</category>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The board of directors are responsible for governance, including risk management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risks are to be identified at a company level, then cascaded with clear ownership through various layers of management and org design. Risks should also be managed for strategic initiatives, projects, critical processes and key stakeholders (clients, suppliers, partners and contractors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds great in theory. But that’s a lot of risks, creating a lot of admin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all talk about risk management, but few of us really do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public companies issue regular risk statements. Often their executives and senior managers have no clue as to what has been published to shareholders and the general public on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single use apps are no good either. We don’t want to open a single use app, just to do risk management. That’s no better than trying to find the last doc or sheet we were using. I cannot count how many board meetings I’ve been to where the risk log is either lost, out of date or deferred over to the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CFOs are in a no-win situation&lt;/strong&gt; taking on risk management.  They face a dual headache:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting people to take ownership of each risk, and the corresponding mitigations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keeping the risk information up to date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#stratapp changes the game on risk management.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two fresh thinking angles behind #stratapp’s approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;#stratapp includes risk management inside what you do strategically and operationally - you don’t have to go to another app or place, it becomes a natural part of daily work for all levels, roles and generations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;#stratapp has dumbed it down to the bare essentials - language and methods &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you already know&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s unpack those two fresh thinking angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-you-already-know&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you already know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us can quickly rattle off the 10 common components of risk management:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Title - what is the risk?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Summary - a brief description of the risk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Impact - how great is the impact if the risk occurs (high/medium/low)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Probability - how likely is the risk to occur (high/medium/low)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Status - where are we at with this risk (urgent, needs attention, under control, closed, draft)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assumptions - what are our assumptions about this risk?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Owner - who owns this risk, and who assigned it to them?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source - what does the risk relate to (goal/objective/action/ project, task or idea)?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Org Design - what org-design attributes correspond to each risk (functions/verticals/horizontals/geography) and how to filter on risks versus these attributes?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security - who can see this risk and who can invite others to see it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the exact same 10 components that make up the risk cards that sit inside #stratapp. And all the other things you need in relation to each risk (meeting notes, tasks, workboards, social collaboration, related items, files and links) are easily accessible in one place, right there on each risk card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/risk matrix.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
… Cox’s risk matrix theorem for rating probability vs impact.  This construct is built into #stratapp.  Risks can be standalone, or added to any of the 9 other apps inside #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine filtering and tracking risks globally or locally by unlimited combinations of geography, levels, functions, verticals and horizontals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-apps-in-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10-apps-in-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, the whole of #stratapp has been designed around what you already know.  We keep it simple across each piece, so your time to value is days - not weeks, months or quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEOs and business owners don’t want to send employees to 10+ different apps to get their work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is 10-apps-in-1, and this includes risk management:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/10 apps in 1 - with title.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-monkey&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Monkey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With #stratapp, CFOs can now thrive when they are thrown the risk management monkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFOs get to elevate how their organization executes on strategy, goals and plans - alongside an intuitive approach to risk management that adds value, rather than just ticking another compliance box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFOs know better than most: ideas are a plenty, execution is what matters!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>venture capital and new tech to create value</title>
        <subheading>I was a VC. I personally loathed reviewing 250 opportunities and meeting 100 founders per year. But I loved the bit that came after: deal structuring, deal closing and working with inspiring founders.</subheading>
        <category>#articles</category>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-vc-role&quot;&gt;my VC role&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post-deal aspects of the VC role were just awesome, balancing my time across four things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensuring clarity on strategy versus what we’ll achieve each quarter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solving problems and assisting with talent and distribution connections&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Searching for ways to go 10x on growth and value creation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planning ahead for the next funding or transaction milestones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-vc-reality&quot;&gt;my VC reality&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look back now I think:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Momentum and clarity gets lost between the cycle of calls/meetings/emails/reports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Founders get overwhelmed with their own learning curve, especially as the company starts to scale, and the personal struggles they are going through often surface too late&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strategy and execution evolves fast, and avoidable mistakes start to kick in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The best and worst of human nature abounds, with no shortage of surprises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-would-have-helped&quot;&gt;what would have helped&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firstly&lt;/strong&gt;, being able to see, in real time, the exact status and underlying cadence on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strategy tree, providing clarity for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decisions/approvals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKRs, balancing strategy and daily execution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;risks/mitigations/assumptions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;projects/tasks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;challenges/ideas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;meetings/actions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;employee sentiment and engagement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;team players/innovators/rising stars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;headlines and an interactive global heatmap, showing what’s hot right now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/alignment-jpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondly&lt;/strong&gt;, being able to freely engage in the debates, discussions and ideas taking place at all different levels inside the investee company. Breaking free of the traditional constraints of functional silos, management hierarchy and meeting cycles. Here is one of many on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/18/elon-musks-productivity-rules-according-to-tesla-email.html&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1582348134617000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHwrSCHL54e38f2AgYLbAW5cfzL5A&quot; title=&quot;Elon Mask&quot;&gt;Elon Mask tackling the problem of silos and hierarchy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thirdly&lt;/strong&gt;, embracing &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/radical-transparency/&quot; title=&quot;radical transparency&quot;&gt;radical transparency&lt;/a&gt;. It is healthy for investee company management and employees to see the VC’s ongoing contributions firsthand. This builds trust and engagement, and it accelerates professional development. Radical Transparency was made famous by &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/principles-by-ray-dalio-embracing-radical-transparency/&quot; title=&quot;Principles by Ray Dalio&quot;&gt;Ray Dalio’s book Principles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;leveraging-tech-to-create-vc-portfolio-value&quot;&gt;leveraging tech to create VC portfolio value&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/best-strategy-execution-software-app/&quot; title=&quot;world's first org-wide strategy execution app&quot;&gt;world’s first org-wide strategy execution app&lt;/a&gt;, delivers on &lt;strong&gt;everything I have listed above&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember during 2005 to 2009 there was a wave of SaaS products for VC portfolio management. I didn’t rate them, as I thought modern CRMs were perfect for tracking opportunities from deal generation through to deal filtering and deal doing. Tier-1 CRMs offer way more flexibility on customising layouts, workflow, dashboards and reporting, not to mention mobile functionality. CRM companies also have bigger budgets to innovate faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However post-deal, the value creation work (ideas, strategies, direction, why, plans, risks, initiatives, projects and day to day execution) needs to sit within the investee company itself. For three reasons: 1) that’s where you want the IP, strategy and execution value created; 2) subsequent investment rounds due-diligence; and 3) effective onboarding of new hires as the company scales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore post-deal, I believe VCs should encourage their investee companies to &lt;strong&gt;embrace #stratapp&lt;/strong&gt;, as it is a &lt;strong&gt;natural win:win:win:win&lt;/strong&gt; for investors:founders:management:employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;subsequent-round-due-diligence--new-hires&quot;&gt;subsequent round due diligence &amp;amp; new hires&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine how simple due-diligence will be on subsequent funding rounds, when the investee company can show inside #stratapp everything that has taken place on the journey thus far - the struggles, the pivots and the wins, and how the culture has evolved over time. Data that is live and interactive, and therefore credible, rather than produced as a one-off exercise to pass DD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same capability provides an incredible onboarding experience for team leaders, managers and executives that join as the investee scales. Taking a pause to look back and learn, is just as important as looking forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;investment-managers--company-directors&quot;&gt;investment managers &amp;amp; company directors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology is fast changing how boards of directors operate, especially on start-ups. Progressive company directors are proficient on SaaS apps for finance, CRM and MarTech. They don’t need to bombard management teams with questions in preparation for board meetings. Progressive company directors can actually drill down inside the SaaS apps that generate the board reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of the board of directors encompasses strategy, execution performance, risk management and culture - which is all at their fingertips inside #stratapp. The rapidly improving aptitude of VCs and company directors to embrace next gen tech is good timing for #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a tier-1 CRM to manage deal flow, engagement, due diligence and completion, as well as overall portfolio reporting and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use #stratapp inside each investee company to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accelerate strategy execution, achieving org-wide engagement and alignment as the investee scales&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;De-risk the investment, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/risk-management-short-version/&quot; title=&quot;making risk management alive and interactive&quot;&gt;bringing risk management alive and interactive&lt;/a&gt; inside the investee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide depth and credibility for passing due diligence on future funding rounds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve the speed and quality of onboarding new hires as the investee scales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>we 45–55yr olds are the problem, not millennials</title>
        <subheading>We have a lot to learn from our millennials. And we don’t know what we don’t know.</subheading>
        <category>#reflections</category>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;meet-patrick&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet Patrick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick is a 45yr old executive, who has just been given a new project by our CEO to figure out how we can launch into the APAC market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick’s first reaction is not excitement or joy. Patrick is trying to figure out if he is being hung out to dry. Who knows. Patrick goes back to his office and starts thinking about who he will involve in this new project. He breaks his list into three groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Givers — those he can extract ideas from, so he may later package them up as his own&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Gatekeepers — folks he must be seen to include, even if he doesn’t intend or want to&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Stepladders — folks he can earn some brownie points with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick starts the tedious back and forth of trying to get into peoples’ diaries, and preparing mini-briefs for subsequent interviews and workshops. In parallel he plans what he will need as a project team, and wonders if he can extract some corporate budget for travel, workshop catering and a few lunches — especially with the Stepladders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;meet-julie&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet Julie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie is a 28yr old who started 8 months ago. The CEO of a similar company has given Julie the exact same project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie is pumped. She immediately jumps on social media to let her friends and colleagues know the CEO has given her this awesome new project. She throws together a digital workboard, and quickly braindumps what she learnt from the CEO’s briefing, and adds a few of her own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She names the workboard “let’s tackle APAC” and invites anyone who wants to join. People of all ages, functions and roles across the company start contributing ideas to Julie’s workboard. As the project is not confidential, Julie has also thrown the workboard out to her social network, university classmates, mentors and past teachers. People have a natural disposition to help, and they love the way Julie is so positive about this project and the potential opportunities for her company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;julie-gets-cracking&quot;&gt;Julie Gets Cracking&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the ideas start to flow in, Julie creates several virtual teams. She breaks the project down into sizeable chunks — competitor research, product selection and pricing, distribution options and marketing — and her friends and colleagues start voluntarily joining and collaborating on the aspects they are interested. The ideas are flowing and within 3 days Julie has generated huge interest and momentum. So far she has 60 people helping her, many of them are interstate and a few are based overseas. 38 are employees of the company, 22 are external.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Patrick, Julie also wants to consult key stakeholders, so she makes a list and invites them to the same digital workboard. Some of them are senior executives in the company, and they are somewhat surprised to find themselves added to different digital groups with a buzz of people interacting from all over the globe on this new project. At first it feels like chaos, but after a day or two of participating these executives start to see the power of what’s taking place: real-time collaboration towards a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Julie creates a google doc, and allows anyone with the link to add comments. She maintains edit control, so she can balance the inputs she is receiving with her own thoughts and research. As she starts to write, about 50 people pop in and out of the live doc to see her progress go from rough notes, to sentences, to something that starts to resemble a business plan. As people add questions and suggestions, other people start to reply before Julie has even had a chance to read the original posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a free flowing exchange of ideas, and the project is racing along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;back-to-patrick&quot;&gt;Back To Patrick&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Patrick has just conducted stakeholder interview number 2. It will take him three more weeks of diary juggling to get through his minimum list of Givers, Gatekeepers and Stepladders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s no bother, because Patrick is already busy writing his report. After all, Patrick has been around the block and is comfortably numb working with what he already knows and can access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Julie, Patrick will keep the first 10 or so iterations of his plan tightly under wraps. He first wants to carefully sound out a few of those Gatekeepers, before letting anyone read or hear what he is really thinking the company should do. If needed he’ll water down his own thinking, to make sure this project doesn’t get him fired or in the bad books with anyone that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-outcomes&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Patrick and Julie finish on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick’s plan has a lot more pages than Julie’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie’s plan is infinitely more creative and it is full of lateral ideas and real life examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But get this. Of the 1,600 employees at Julie’s company, over 140 have volunteered themselves into Julie’s project. Think of the power of that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes time to move from theory to implementation, Julie has already created this virtual community of folks who are interested in the project. Folks who had an opportunity to contribute. Folks who learnt heaps from their interactions with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie doesn’t care where the best ideas came from. Julie just wants the best result. She also wants to learn new things, make new friends and have a good time. Hats off to Julie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked with about 400 “Patricks” across six countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer how millennials roll.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>radical transparency suits all generations, not only millennials</title>
        <subheading>Radical transparency was made famous by Ray Dalio's book Principles.</subheading>
        <category>#articles</category>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ray Dalio champions the principle of embracing thoughtful disagreement. The ability to exchange controversial ideas without causing problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His solution is to consciously ask each other:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How am I going to be with you? How should you be with me?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is it okay for me to be honest with you, that is, me telling you what I really think?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are you okay being honest with me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray Dalio argues: “In order to be successful, we have to have independent thinkers — so independent that they’ll bet against the consensus.” And to do that, “You have to put your honest thoughts on the table.” Then, the best ideas rise to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;millennials-and-radical-transparency&quot;&gt;Millennials and Radical Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millennials have their own take on radical transparency - as consumers, and as employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;millennials-as-consumers&quot;&gt;Millennials as Consumers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millennials as consumers are demanding greater transparency through the supply chain. Recent surveys suggest millennials as consumers as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;42% researching where and how goods are made, including the source products&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;66% willing to pay more for sustainable goods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50% considering the resale value of new items before purchase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2019/05/29/3-ways-millennials-and-gen-z-consumers-are-radically-transforming-the-luxury-market/#a8663ac479fd&quot; title=&quot;Forbes&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/the-year-ahead-the-case-for-radical-transparency&quot; title=&quot;BoF&quot;&gt;BoF&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/42057-Are-You-Ready-for-the-Honest-Generation-&quot; title=&quot;CSR Wire&quot;&gt;CSR Wire&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This behaviour is driving value-chain innovation, including tracking from farm/ocean-to-plate on food, from field-to-outlet on textiles, and from consumer-to-recycled for almost every consumer product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;millennials-as-employees&quot;&gt;Millennials as Employees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millennials as employees are rewriting the social contract at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their thinking brings a fresh new perspective to the relationship between employer and employee:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want me to be committed to my role and this company, show me the same. Let us see what you are doing as the owner/CEO/executive/leader/boss to take this company forward. Show me you are truly committed to our success and that you genuinely represent the company’s values. Do that, and I’ll show you the same as your employee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ceos-dilemma&quot;&gt;The CEO’s Dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a big shift in employee thinking. The wave is imminent, because by 2025 more than 75% of employees will comprise millennials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top-down messaging and control does not motivate millennials. One could argue it didn’t really motivate X-Gen either, but they towed the line, stayed with their employer for 3+ years and got the work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progressive leaders, including X-Gen and Baby Boomers, are ready to embrace org-wide engagement and radical transparency. Not just to please millennials. Progressive leaders have already seen first hand the power of collaboration tech in small teams - usually the product, digital marketing and tech teams operating inside their own companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;achieving-radical-transparency&quot;&gt;Achieving Radical Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, how to make that powerful collaboration experience org-wide, so that radical transparency becomes a natural part of company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social and work collaboration tools (#slack, yammer, teams, trello, asana, etc) have been a huge step forward since 2009. But these apps still lack structure, an org-wide UX and a strategic context. This creates two problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The risk of adding more distractions and noise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of adoption by executives and senior managers … bottom up collaboration, whilst positive, loses impact if the decision makers vacate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt collaboration tech beats email and static documents. However, collaboration tech today has been designed for small teams of 5 to 30 people. Turn those apps on for hundreds or thousands of employees and the risk is chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;imagine-the-future&quot;&gt;Imagine the Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve radical transparency at work, companies need collaboration tech that has been designed from the outset as an org-wide experience - tech that adds value daily to every employee, across all levels, roles and generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add value org-wide means helping employees with their day to day work, as well as enabling them to contribute to the strategic context and corresponding initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-context&quot;&gt;Strategic Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if radical transparency could sit within an easy to view strategic context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why is our organization here? (a la Simon Sinek)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are we trying to achieve? (a la Prof Roger Martin)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How are we going to get there? (cascading strategy tree)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How are we going right now? (live collaboration at every level in the strategy tree)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would allow every employee to embrace and contribute to what their CEO, executives and managers are trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such radical transparency delivers on the new social contract of &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/millennials/&quot; title=&quot;how millennials collaborate&quot;&gt;our millennials&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First show me you are committed, then you’ll see my commitment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;org-wide-engagement&quot;&gt;Org-Wide Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A seamless org-wide experience also means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Org-design attributes (e.g. @F/sales + @G/APAC) to easily invite people to strategic initiatives, projects, meetings, ideas, challenges, risks, messages, cards and workboards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Powerful filters and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/atlassian-stride-social-with-structure/&quot; title=&quot;social with structure&quot;&gt;social-with-structure&lt;/a&gt;, so people can quickly see exactly what they need to&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy to understand security levels, so that radical transparency doesn’t become radically out of control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intuitive user experiences, so people of all tech aptitudes don’t need to be trained on how to use it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stratapp&quot;&gt;#stratapp&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This future state tech has arrived. It’s called #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp frees you to deliver on everything described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With #stratapp you can embrace radical transparency and achieve genuine org-wide collaboration - across all levels, roles and generations - within the relevant strategic context of why the organization exists and what it is trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>employees working remotely: key to succeeding that most of us leaders take for granted</title>
        <subheading>How to solve for employees working remotely whilst building a strategic capability to scale up or down.</subheading>
        <category>#articles</category>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-remotely-5-basics&quot;&gt;working remotely: 5 basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees need these five basics to work remotely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reliable fast internet and electricity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workspace and devices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email and shared docs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social and work collaboration tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mutual trust, positivity, recognition and commitment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-remotely-key-to-succeeding&quot;&gt;working remotely: key to succeeding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For working remotely to be &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sustainable&lt;/strong&gt;, employees need more than just social chat and video calls, &lt;strong&gt;employees need context&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/simon sinek.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp makes it easy for business owners, CEOs, executives, managers and team leaders to deliver context - seamlessly connecting strategy/vision/plans with day to day work/engagement/collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context is the key to making remote working effective and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-context&quot;&gt;strategic context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why does my organization exist? [a la &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/how-great-leaders-inspire-action-by-simon-sinek/&quot; title=&quot;how great leaders inspire action by Simon Sinek&quot;&gt;Simon Sinek&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is our winning aspiration? [a la &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/professor-roger-martin-on-what-ceos-should-really-be-doing/&quot; title=&quot;what CEOs should really be doing by Professor Roger Martin&quot;&gt;Professor Roger Martin&lt;/a&gt;]
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Where to play?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How to win?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What capabilities do we need?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What management systems do we need?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is our plan to get there?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Goals -&amp;gt; Sub-Goals -&amp;gt; Actions -&amp;gt; Sub-Actions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; each of these &lt;em&gt;strategic contexts&lt;/em&gt; are easy features inside #stratapp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-to-day-context&quot;&gt;day-to-day context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is working on what right now?  How can I add value?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How is my team going?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What should I work on next to have the greatest impact?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How are each of these digital items connected?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This meeting&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The task this meeting relates to&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The workboard/project/initiative that task sits on&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The strategic objective that workboard belongs to&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The strategic goal above that objective&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The overall why and direction that strategic goal is pointing at&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; each of these &lt;em&gt;day to day contexts&lt;/em&gt; are powered by #stratapp, as an intuitive org-wide experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-remotely-live-meeting-notes&quot;&gt;working remotely: live meeting notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many meetings and calls do you do each day?  Multiply that across one month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if all participants were on the same (digital) page - live editing together, sharing ideas within structured social, adding files and links, and capturing actions.  Then in one click seeing all actions, from all meetings and calls, neatly displayed on your workspace, in a way you can easily trace back to their individual sources and context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/the-anonymous-gavel/&quot; title=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/the-anonymous-gavel/&quot;&gt;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/the-anonymous-gavel/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-remotely-social-with-structure&quot;&gt;working remotely: social with structure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp wasn’t the first SaaS company to think of this, but we are the first to bring it to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Adding structure to social collaboration saves everybody an enormous amount of time. Not only for your recipients, but also for you when coming back to check what you have asked, assigned or provided to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp allows you to tag your social posts as one of ten categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/social post.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;example #1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve been away for 72 hours. What strategy related questions have been asked, and what decisions or approvals have been made, whilst I was away? Great, now let’s narrow that down further to only the strategy aspects I own or am directly involved in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;example #2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the risks, ideas and challenges I currently own, what is the status of tasks I have assigned to others?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;example #3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who is having the most influence on strategy or KPI related work? Who are the emerging team players on KPIs? Who are the emerging innovators on strategy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the power of social with structure, you can read &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/atlassian-stride-social-with-structure/&quot; title=&quot;Atlassian thought of it, #stratapp's done it&quot;&gt;Atlassian thought of it, #stratapp’s done it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-remotely-scale-up-or-down&quot;&gt;working remotely: scale up or down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic opportunity is to achieve scale through offshoring, rather than replacing your onshore talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have #stratapp and effective remote working up and running, you can easily create the capability to scale, both up and down, through a hybrid approach to offshoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fast-track-your-best-talent&quot;&gt;fast track your best talent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use hybrid offshoring to accelerate the professional development of our best people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is usually not cost, time or risk feasible to build up an onshore team of 5 employees under a 25 year old. However, the combination of #stratapp and a hybrid approach to offshoring opens up new possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than have the onshore 25 year olds working 120% of the week, I coach them to split their time to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50% producing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;20% improving how work gets done&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;30% managing a team of 5 people offshore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming the 5x offshore team members are each effective to a net 75% (adjusting for location, learning, development, admin and internal events) we have now increased the overall capacity of each 25 year old to 425%.  Pause for a moment, think about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then ask them to dial back to 100%, rather than work 120%, so they can invest more personal time into fitness, recreation, learning, loved ones and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, our 25 year olds are now on a fast track to professional development, rapidly learning new skills on managing people, x-border cultural differences and how to &lt;em&gt;work on the business&lt;/em&gt; not just in it.  That’s an incredible learning opportunity at such a young age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the 25 year olds often end up managing higher skilled staff offshore, which further contributes to their own professional development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you multiply this effect across fifty 25 year olds in your company, you create an enormous capability to scale, &lt;em&gt;both up and down&lt;/em&gt;.  In one relatively easy strategic move you increase morale, profits and resilience, whilst de-risking the overall business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-next-evolution-of-scaling-best-talent&quot;&gt;the next evolution of scaling best talent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago I started experimenting with this hybrid approach to offshoring. I didn’t foresee it back then, but now we find ourselves at the next evolution: &lt;em&gt;thinking about how to scale up and give early career development experience to our best people based offshore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, we are now exploring which countries to add new team members to work for our emerging offshore talent.  As my mate Rob says: “Ash, you’re offshoring the offshoring!”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Coronavirus: working remotely as a proactive crisis management and business continuity response</title>
        <subheading>Several countries, including the USA, Singapore, Italy and South Korea, have recently found themselves working from home. #stratapp helps make this a positive disruption.</subheading>
        <category>#reflections</category>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-remotely-the-basics&quot;&gt;working remotely: the basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees need these five basics to work remotely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reliable fast internet and electricity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workspace and devices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email and shared docs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social and work collaboration tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mutual trust, positivity, recognition and commitment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-remotely-key-to-succeeding&quot;&gt;working remotely: key to succeeding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make working remotely both &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sustainable&lt;/strong&gt;, employees need one more critical thing that most of us in leadership roles take for granted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/simon sinek.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp makes it easy for business owners, CEOs, executives, managers and team leaders to deliver context - seamlessly connecting strategy/vision/plans with day to day work/engagement/collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context is the key to making remote working effective and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-context&quot;&gt;strategic context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why does my organization exist? [a la &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/how-great-leaders-inspire-action-by-simon-sinek/&quot; title=&quot;how great leaders inspire action by Simon Sinek&quot;&gt;Simon Sinek&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is our winning aspiration? [a la &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/professor-roger-martin-on-what-ceos-should-really-be-doing/&quot; title=&quot;what CEOs should really be doing by Professor Roger Martin&quot;&gt;Professor Roger Martin&lt;/a&gt;]
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Where to play?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How to win?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What capabilities do we need?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What management systems do we need?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is our plan to get there?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Goals -&amp;gt; Sub-Goals-&amp;gt; Actions -&amp;gt; Sub-Actions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; each of these &lt;em&gt;strategic contexts&lt;/em&gt; are easy features inside #stratapp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-to-day-context&quot;&gt;day-to-day context&lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;The workboard that task sits on&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The strategic objective that workboard belongs to&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The strategic goal above that objective&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The overall why and direction that strategic goal is pointing at&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

        <title>what’s really going on in my company?</title>
        <subheading>We have 22 software applications. We average 200 emails and 5 hours of meetings or calls per person per day, alongside 20 instant messages per hour.  Everyone seems a bit stressed and I keep hearing how busy and time poor we all are. </subheading>
        <category>#articles</category>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Year on year I see daily priorities pulling our time and focus away from achieving our strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep reflecting on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People&quot; title=&quot;Stephen Covey's four quadrants&quot;&gt;Stephen Covey’s four quadrants&lt;/a&gt; and how he uniquely describes the challenge of balancing urgent vs what’s really important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am the CEO. I have 8 direct reports and 1,400 employees spread across 6 locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that tinkering at the edges won’t work. I have decided to fundamentally rethink how I run this company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-more-offsite-annual-planning&quot;&gt;no more offsite annual planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I am going to stop doing our big offsite annual planning workshops, which in the end only motivate a subset of those whom were able to attend. Every year we come away from those strategy offsites with a slide deck that most folks subsequently ignore or don’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, this year I am going to make strategy and execution alive and interactive. I want us to constantly apply what we are learning each week, rather than consider strategy as an annual exercise or a static document.  I might have been inspired by that acclaimed Harvard Business Review article on “&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/your-strategy-should-be-a-hypothesis-you-constantly-adjust-by-hbr-org/&quot; title=&quot;HBR article&quot;&gt;your strategy should be a hypothesis you constantly adjust&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, I am going to give every employee #stratapp, the world’s first org-wide strategy execution app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reduce-our-22-it-systems-down-to-5&quot;&gt;reduce our 22 IT systems down to 5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I am going to reduce our 22 different IT systems down to only 5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;#stratapp - for both strategic and day to day work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CRM+desk - for customer relationships and support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finance - for compliance and operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HR - for compliance and operations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comms - for email and document sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the social media platforms we use for lead generation and referral sales, these 5 systems will be it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;everyone-collaborating-in-the-same-space&quot;&gt;everyone collaborating in the same space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We lose so much time having people working in disparate systems, including a bunch of different apps for social, tasks, projects, meetings and note taking. Quite often several of us are sitting in meetings and writing down our own subjective interpretation of the notes and actions, in different formats and places. #stratapp has live notes, including a timed meeting agenda and one click access to the meeting context, social, tasks, files and links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have totally lost patience with IT integrations - trying to get a dozen different systems to talk to each other and constantly chasing our tail each year on upgrades and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/stratapp-explainer-video/&quot; title=&quot;10 apps in 1&quot;&gt;10 apps in 1&lt;/a&gt;, so we will use #stratapp to align every employee on both strategic and daily work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/10 apps in 1 - with title.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-new-operating-principles&quot;&gt;3 new operating principles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I am going to introduce 3 new operating principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No internal email&lt;/strong&gt; - all internal comms will be inside #stratapp, using their &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/atlassian-stride-social-with-structure/&quot; title=&quot;social with structure&quot;&gt;social with structure&lt;/a&gt;. Eliminating internal email will reduce emails from 200+ to about 15 per person per day. It will also make checking and replying to emails way more interesting and actually adding value.  Why?  Because all emails hitting our inboxes will be external - from customers, partners and suppliers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt; - we will encourage staff to make social and work collaboration transparent inside #stratapp, rather than marking everything as confidential or secret. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/principles-by-ray-dalio-embracing-radical-transparency/&quot; title=&quot;Ray Dalio&quot;&gt;Ray Dalio&lt;/a&gt; has proven that org-wide transparency elevates individual, team, manager, executive and overall company performance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment&lt;/strong&gt; - we will strive to ensure that every task, initiative, project, idea, challenge, risk or note we are working on, has a direct or indirect link to our strategy tree.  Aligning day to day work to strategy is easy to do inside #stratapp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I am done with tinkering at the edges.  It is time for us to rethink how we run this company - for the benefit of all levels, roles and generations, not to mention our customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 reasons why #stratapp is the best strategy execution software app in the world right now</title>
        <subheading>Until now strategy execution software apps have focused on ideation and strategy development, giving people “inside the strat-dev circle” the tools and methodologies they need to create and articulate strategy.</subheading>
        <category>#articles</category>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At #stratapp, we started to think about &lt;strong&gt;how to engage 100% of employees&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than only those folks who are lucky enough to be inside the strat-dev circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? The historical challenge for business owners, CEOs and management consultants has not been a lack of ideas or the process of strategy development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is strategy execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it bluntly, strategy execution rarely meets expectations, as brilliantly articulated by Richard Rumelt in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/good-strategy-bad-strategy-by-richard-rumelt/&quot; title=&quot;Good Strategy Bad Strategy&quot;&gt;Good Strategy Bad Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how #stratapp helps make strategy execution consistently exceed expectations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Org-Wide&lt;/strong&gt; - designed and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/pricing/&quot; title=&quot;#stratapp pricing&quot;&gt;priced&lt;/a&gt; from the outset as an org-wide every-employee user experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intuitive&lt;/strong&gt; - easy to use for all levels, roles and generations - applying what you already know&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt; - innovating further on existing social and work collaboration apps, then adding the most important ingredient - the &lt;em&gt;strategic context&lt;/em&gt; of why the organization exists and what it is trying to achieve&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily&lt;/strong&gt; - adding value to every employee daily, supporting them on both daily and strategic work - thereby making sure the strategic context and goals/objectives/actions/projects remain front of mind&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radical&lt;/strong&gt; - helping business owners and CEOs actually achieve &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/radical-transparency/&quot; title=&quot;Radical Transparency from Ray Dalio&quot;&gt;Ray Dalio’s radical transparency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategy execution starts with leadership.  Here is a quick video on #stratapp and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqsXkZs75Lk&quot; title=&quot;The Leadership Cycle&quot;&gt;The Leadership Cycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you become a passionate advocate of #stratapp, the strategy execution app that even &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/millennials/&quot; title=&quot;Millennials vs Y Gen&quot;&gt;millennials&lt;/a&gt; love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also like to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/atlassian-stride-social-with-structure/&quot; title=&quot;social with structure&quot;&gt;why we’ve added structure to social&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a CEO, business owner or CxO, you will probably enjoy “&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratapp.ai/blog/what-is-really-going-on-in-my-company/&quot; title=&quot;what's really going on in my company?&quot;&gt;what’s really going on in my company?&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>creating a connected workspace</title>
        <subheading>The burning question hammering away became: how do I enable my teams for success? For me, the answer was clear – create a simple and connected workspace. </subheading>
        <category>#reflections</category>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marten, we currently use Jira, Confluence, Xero, Salesforce, Harvest, Google Docs and Slack, and I still have no idea what’s happening in my business.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I cannot say this enough: the proliferation of niche technology along with legacy ERP, CRM and HCM technology has created an environment of unnecessary complexity. This impacts every element of our business and most importantly our people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every company I’ve been involved with typically enabled systems that were in the best interest of the company, not always their employees. We forced a series of fragmented tools on our teams that required manual entry and, in some cases, double handling – so the company could get the answer it craved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a young senior leader launching new markets across Asia-Pacific, it dawned on me that I was doing the same things. As a result making the job unnecessarily harder for my teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-teams-and-global-leaders-are-talking&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;our teams and global leaders are talking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And clearly it’s on other’s radars. Recently on LinkedIn there was an interesting post on the CRM landscape being a dumping ground for information. Meaning it became a forced mechanism for employees to enter data (typically late and isolated from the wider group) so the company can get some level of data and top down accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another post was about ‘how they had to touch 5 apps to deliver on one simple task’. The thousands of responses empathised and echoed their frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burning question hammering away became: how do I enable my teams for success? For me, the answer was clear – create a simple and connected workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-simple-and-connected-workspace-requires-a-new-way-of-thinking&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;creating a simple and connected workspace requires a new way of thinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how? We need to start from the ground and work up, not the top down business models we have built over the generations. We need to think about the tools our people need to plan, align, prioritise, execute and collaborate. I believe this framework will empower teams to take ownership of their workspace like never before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to give them a single space to work, in one simple to use app. I believe it will have an org-wide impact on culture and performance. This is not a new way of working, it’s a new way of thinking at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It amazes me when you think about it – we come to work to create, align, prioritise, communicate and execute the plan. But the more founders, CEOs, executives and teams I speak with, it appears that procuring a tool that can achieve all this, while delivering a personalised and delightful experience at all levels, is not among their top five tech acquisitions in 2020!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-stratapp&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;about #stratapp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp rethinks the way companies link the business plan with day-to-day work, or should I say link day-to-day work with the business plan. A single place the company, team and employee can align, prioritise, collaborate and execute what matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick reads:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The New Future of Work, a Sam Harris podcast conversation with Matt Mullenweg on distributed working</title>
        <subheading>I’m feeling a bit awkward.  Why?  I’ve just heard another tech founder articulate the value pitch for our product, way better than I ever have.</subheading>
        <category>#reflections</category>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://samharris.org/podcasts/194-new-future-work/&quot; title=&quot;The New Future of Work&quot;&gt;Sam Harris’ podcast conversation, The New Future of Work, with Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt; is truly inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt is the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://automattic.com/&quot; title=&quot;Automattic&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind Wordpress.com, Tumblr and WooCommerce. Every day, every employee at Automattic works from wherever they want to. Automattic does not have offices. Automattic has 1,200 employees working from 75 countries and speaking over 90 languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After listening to their conversation, I’ll now have to stop myself using the term “remote working”. Remote from what? Distributed working, with no offices to be remote from, is the new future of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;distributed-working---5-levels&quot;&gt;distributed working - 5 levels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his conversation with Sam, and in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.tt/2020/04/five-levels-of-autonomy/&quot; title=&quot;Distributed Work's Five Levels of Automony&quot;&gt;follow-up blog post by Matt&lt;/a&gt;, Matt describes 5 levels of autonomy in distributed work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/distributed working levels -matt mullenweg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;distributed-working---challenges&quot;&gt;distributed working - challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt is articulate, open and reflective when talking with Sam. I could listen to the two of them all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He describes with candor the challenges of achieving level 4 and striving to level 5, and he provides some great insights on how they solve these challenges at Automattic. Matt explains the moral imperative of moving to a distributed model and the benefits to work:life balance, relationships, productivity, risk (when you pause to think COVID-19 won’t be a one off event, and in many respects this is a rather mild version of pandemic threats), resilience, shareholders and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com.au/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805&quot; title=&quot;Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us&quot;&gt;Daniel Pink’s work in the book Drive&lt;/a&gt;, which Matt describes as: “&lt;em&gt;if you want people to be happy, motivated, content, satisfied and fulfilled in their work, it’s not really about compensation or giving them bonuses … it’s really about three things: &lt;strong&gt;mastery, autonomy and purpose&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me as I was listening to this, yet another brilliant interview by Sam, is the extensive efforts Matt and his team have gone to to make distributed working actually work. Not just their clever org design thinking and ability to learn objectively and evolve way beyond what analysts thought possible. What really caught my attention (and that of a shareholder who sent me the podcast) is their underlying tech set-up, and the leadership, discipline and processes it must take to induct, adhere to, keep organized and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;distributed-working---making-it-work&quot;&gt;distributed working - making it work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automattic has pulled together a whole bunch of different tech capabilities to make distributed working actually work. When I listen to how Matt describes these enabling capabilities, almost everything he mentions is out-of-the-box and ready to go inside #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence my awkward realization. Matt Mullenweg can explain the value of #stratapp, way better than I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;matching-matts-thinking-to-stratapps-features&quot;&gt;matching Matt’s thinking to #stratapp’s features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of the existing out-of-the-box features inside #stratapp, as they directly correspond to the capabilities Matt describes in his conversation with Sam:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live Meeting Notes&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt articulates the importance of live meeting notes, to reflect the shared understanding on what’s agreed to. This is a core feature of #stratapp (including a timed agenda, live editing, private notes, social chat, links and meeting actions that automatically appear in your workspace). You can link the Live Meeting Note to any workboard or card (strategy, OKR, risk, idea or task) inside #stratapp, so you can easily keep track of what Live Meeting Notes belong to what, and easily navigate back to the source.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social with Context&lt;/strong&gt; - Automattic have configured an internal blogging solution, so that the organization can collaborate on topics, with nested conversations, including search and keyword trending. This is built into #stratapp. Not only that, those nested and searchable social conversations take place on each card or workboard, giving immediate context to the social conversations and appropriate notifications. #stratapp presents global hashtag popular vs trending data, and trending conversations are presented across strategy. Imagine all that, combined with powerful filters and one click access to the source and context.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social with Structure&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt describes how writing with clarity is key for distributed working. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/atlassian-stride-social-with-structure/&quot; title=&quot;Atlassian thought of it, #stratapp’s done it - social with structure&quot;&gt;Atlassian came up with an idea to tag social posts&lt;/a&gt; as a comment, action or decision. #stratapp has taken that to a whole new level with: &lt;em&gt;comment, agree, disagree, question, task, risk, idea, decision, decision request, approval, approval request, response request or note that&lt;/em&gt;. Imagine the power of that, for example: &lt;em&gt;I’ve been away for 72 hours. What strategy related questions have been asked, and what decisions or approvals have been made, whilst I was away? Great, now let’s narrow that down further to only the strategy aspects I own or am directly involved in.&lt;/em&gt; Matt describes how it is critical to find something to replace email. We agree, #stratapp kills internal email.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direction &amp;amp; Strategy&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt talks about allowing people to see, understand and contribute from all over the world, at a time of day that best suits each of them as individuals. Again, this is natural part of #stratapp’s design, whilst applying the latest frameworks from Harvard, Dr Roger Martin, Richard Rumelt and Simon Sinek, in a simple and easy to understand UX that every employee can engage on, with little or no end user training.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live Org Chart&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt describes how in some ways the methods and culture of distributed working make it easier to see who is working on what right now, as opposed to the well dressed employee who turns up early everyday, asks smart questions and might be doing nothing for weeks or months whilst looking busy at their cubicle. #stratapp takes radical transparency to a whole new level. You can browse a Live Org Chart to see the latest direct and matrix reporting lines, and you can also see who is working on what right now, the status and interactions, and the progress on the OKRs they own; with these views of course subject to security settings. This functionality takes collaboration to a whole new level, especially for millennials and new joiners, who are proactively looking to get up to speed and contribute beyond their immediate set of assigned tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Org Design&lt;/strong&gt; - there are 11 attributes of org design, and as you shift to distributed working being able to tap into these is a game changer for connecting and collaborating with the people and teams you need to, without having to remember individual names. #stratapp is the world’s first SaaS app to build @org-design into both social and work collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output Matters, not the Hours Worked&lt;/strong&gt; - Matt talks about removing the hard-wired lizard-brain bias we all have. One thing I love with #stratapp, is being able to see the work of all levels in the organization, and to interact within the context of that work. Output is what matters, and #stratapp helps you achieve Ray Dalio’s thinking on an ideas meritocracy - an environment where the best idea wins, not those of positional power. I also love the bottom-up accountability. When a person 4-5 management levels below asks me a question on a card or workboard inside #stratapp, I feel compelled to answer thoughtfully and timely, as a bunch of our colleagues at all levels will probably see the interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well Being &amp;amp; Work:Life Balance&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a core value of Automattic and we have some exciting ideas for our product roadmap. Right now we add value through real time clarity, structure and context - we give a purpose to the work and we power autonomy. We also kill about 95% of internal email without flooding users with a firehose of random social posts - that alone seems to elevate employee well being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon reflection, I wish I had reached out to Matt a few years ago as we were starting our journey on product design. I think he would have saved us a few iterations and lots of time to arrive at the wonderful UX and roadmap we have now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;distributed-working---seamless-ex&quot;&gt;distributed working - seamless EX&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp makes it easy to provide all levels of your organization with autonomy and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is the world’s first SaaS product to bring together strategy, OKRs, people and work into one seamless employee experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/alignment-jpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;distributed-working---journey-success&quot;&gt;distributed working - journey success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://samharris.org/podcasts/194-new-future-work/&quot; title=&quot;The New Future of Work&quot;&gt;Sam Harris’ podcast conversation, The New Future of Work, with Matt Mullenweg&lt;/a&gt;, and as you start to think about your organization’s journey to what Matt describes as levels 3, 4 and 5, I encourage you to embrace #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp will make your journey through levels 3 and 4, and then onto 5, so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>we have apps for revenue, finance and people - what about running the company?</title>
        <subheading>Running a company as a business owner or CEO is tough going, it's not for the fainthearted.</subheading>
        <category>#articles</category>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The challenge comes down to people - having everyone aligned, engaged and motivated on the same end game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, there are apps for almost everything (CRM, service/support, finance, HR, supply chain, projects and social), but there has never been a simple app for actually running the company - providing real time clarity and context for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is that app. #stratapp makes life way easier for owners/CEOs and their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-natural-flow-as-easy-as-this&quot;&gt;a natural flow, as easy as this&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategy execution wins with bottom up engagement and real-time alignment, in way that flows naturally as employees collaborate on day to day work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine you’re a team leader or mid-level manager.  You open your &lt;em&gt;workspace&lt;/em&gt; inside #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see a &lt;em&gt;task&lt;/em&gt; due Thursday that says “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;select workshop venue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re busy and you can’t remember where that &lt;em&gt;task&lt;/em&gt; came from, so you click and see all collaboration taking place on that &lt;em&gt;task&lt;/em&gt;.  Nothing fancy right?  Sounds like a task app.  Nope, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see the source of the &lt;em&gt;task&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;meeting&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You click and see the &lt;em&gt;meeting&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;purpose (“&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;agree next steps for the supply chain review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;agenda&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;live notes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;actions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;social conversations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;files and links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… everything at your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you understand the context of the &lt;em&gt;task&lt;/em&gt;.  It’s making sense.  But then you think, why were we having this &lt;em&gt;meeting&lt;/em&gt; in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see the source of the &lt;em&gt;meeting&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;strategic action&lt;/em&gt; to “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;reduce supply chain costs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”.  It’s making more sense now!  In one click, you see all collaboration taking place on that &lt;em&gt;strategic action&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you’re curious!  What’s behind the &lt;em&gt;strategic action?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One click and you’re at the &lt;em&gt;strategic objective&lt;/em&gt; above it to “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;improve gross profit through product and supply chain innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;consistent-user-experience&quot;&gt;consistent user experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beautiful thing about #stratapp is how the user experience is consistent as you move across those:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tasks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;meetings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strategic actions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;strategic objectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same consistency applies to all features inside #stratapp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKRs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ideas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;challenges&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;risks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;project workboards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;easy-to-implement&quot;&gt;easy to implement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consistent user experience means minimal or no end user training - and happy employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that, you can roll out the app in phases.  Yes, that’s right, you can turn different parts of the app on for individual users and/or select teams based on your unique org design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;connected-workspace&quot;&gt;connected workspace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the power of 5, 10, 50, 500 or 50,000 employees aligned on the same priorities and plans, able to see in real time exactly where their day to day work fits in and the impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp allows you, and everyone around you, to focus on what really matters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/alignment-jpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;end-result&quot;&gt;end result&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to micro-manage, rely on retrospective reporting or integrate 10 different systems - the work, alignment and productivity flows naturally - in one simple app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One simple app to run the company.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>top 5 don'ts on OKRs</title>
        <subheading>OKRs are brilliant, but - top 5, learnt from the best</subheading>
        <category>#okr</category>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;okrs-dont-1&quot;&gt;OKRs don’t #1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t start with OKRs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with the strategy tree and your leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB - after reading this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/DqsXkZs75Lk&quot; title=&quot;the leadership cycle&quot;&gt;watch this short video&lt;/a&gt; to learn about the leadership cycle and strategy tree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okrs-dont-2&quot;&gt;OKRs don’t #2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t stop evolving your strategy&lt;/strong&gt; whilst executing monthly or quarterly OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategy formation and evolution should never stop.  Your strategy tree should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;live and interactive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;accessible to everyone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cascading to execution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;guided by your vision, why and direction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okrs-dont-3&quot;&gt;OKRs don’t #3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t say to employees: “&lt;em&gt;We are rolling out OKRs&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs are one piece of a bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs are brilliant for strategy execution, however there is increasing confusion and misinformation on OKRs - especially from folks who only scratch the service when trying to learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend communicating with the bigger picture: &lt;em&gt;our leadership team have recently been working together in one digital workspace for ideation + planning + strategy + execution, and now we want to progressively open that up to the whole company, so we can evolve these together with you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okrs-dont-4&quot;&gt;OKRs don’t #4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t confuse OKRs with KPIs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs: &lt;em&gt;one-off lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, limited to only 2 to 4 objectives per quarter for every 500 employees&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPIs: &lt;em&gt;ongoing lifetime&lt;/em&gt; and you may have 10 to 250 indicators worth tracking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you see KPIs going off track, or when you think of new ideas for strategy or capabilities, that’s when you introduce OKRs - &lt;em&gt;to get it done!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okrs-dont-5&quot;&gt;OKRs don’t #5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t rollout &lt;em&gt;a single-use-app&lt;/em&gt; for OKRs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 reasons to avoid single-use-apps for OKRs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; - for many employees, it will feel like just another tracking or accountability tool.  As brilliant as OKRs are, if employees feel that, execution will fade over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;go for next gen tech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that allows you to: a) create the strategy tree to a 12 to 36 month horizon; b) add OKRs to any level of the strategy tree; c) evolve and execute off the strategy tree* whilst at the same time executing OKRs (i.e. per “OKR don’t #2” above, strategy evolution and execution never stops); d) tie together execution of &lt;em&gt;strategy + OKRs + daily work&lt;/em&gt;, into one digital workspace (thereby achieving &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/radical-transparency/&quot; title=&quot;Ray Dalio's radical transparency&quot;&gt;Ray Dalio’s radical transparency&lt;/a&gt;) so that leaders can efficiently engage/contribute/support/coach at all levels on execution, in real time, rather than looking at dashboards and trying to figure out what’s really happening&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* by execute, I mean everything you need to execute, hanging straight off your strategy tree in the same digital workspace: social with structure (e.g. approvals, decisions, requests); social powered by org design; tasks; project workboards; risks; ideas; challenges to crowdsource new ideas; live meeting notes; and a live org chart showing who is working on what right now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; - if you solve 2) you will create unlimited opportunities for leaders to lead, and the transparency will radically elevate org-wide performance and culture.  Think about this.  No matter how good your leaders are, or how good their work ethic and intentions are, leadership is critically diluted if bouncing across different apps and integrations to support their teams on what ends up being fragmented views of strategy and execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB - #stratapp is the world’s first (&lt;em&gt;and thus far only&lt;/em&gt;) B2B SaaS app that achieves both 2) and 3) above.  Leaders have the opportunity to lead.  Employee rising stars have the opportunity to shine, and to receive appreciation, unconstrained by org hierarchy and political silos (you might like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://cleantechnica.com/2018/05/15/elon-musk-takes-on-corporate-hierarchy-in-note-to-tesla-employees/&quot; title=&quot;Elon Musk on corporate hierarchy&quot;&gt;thinking on corporate hierarchy from Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we are copied by others, #stratapp will already be onto building phase 2 of our 5 phase roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention these &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/resources/&quot; title=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;inspiring books and articles&lt;/a&gt; by thought leaders like Richard Rumelt, Simon Sinek, Ray Dalio, Prof Roger Martin, John Doerr and Ricardo Semler.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>7 steps to successfully implement OKRs</title>
        <subheading>OKRs are brilliant - but ironically, the key to success is don't start with OKRs</subheading>
        <category>#okr</category>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you hear this from a CEO or CxO role: “&lt;em&gt;Yes, our employees are doing OKRs&lt;/em&gt;”, you might want to short-the-stock as their OKR implementation will most likely fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs are brilliant for strategy execution.  However, to be successful you need to start your OKR implementation with the CEO and leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, OKRs are not the best starting point.  Before adopting OKRs, you first need to make sure your leadership team is aligned on and evolving the &lt;em&gt;strategy tree&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implement-okrs---the-strategy-tree&quot;&gt;implement OKRs - the strategy tree&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best practice is to align your OKRs to the strategy tree, per this extract from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-the-leadership-cycle&quot; title=&quot;the leadership cycle&quot;&gt;the leadership cycle&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/strategy-tree-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp allows the flexibility to hang OKRs off any level in the strategy tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/best-OKR-software-app/&quot; title=&quot;best OKR software app&quot;&gt;best OKR software app in the world right now&lt;/a&gt;, bringing &lt;em&gt;strategy + OKRs + execution&lt;/em&gt; into one seamless digital workspace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/strategy-okrs-execution.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, as good as they are, not all of your strategy execution needs to be done through OKRs.  #stratapp has been designed with this real-world insight front of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, you can execute strategy in a way that best suits your business.  You don’t have to change your business to suit the app.  This makes your time-to-value on #stratapp just days, rather than months or quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is powered by @org-design, so it works seamlessly for 5 to 500,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1---start-with-the-strategy-tree&quot;&gt;step #1 - start with the strategy tree&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step #1 is to start with the strategy tree and the leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define &lt;em&gt;the leadership team&lt;/em&gt; as the top 10 to 15 in the organization - fewer for smaller companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with the strategy tree and the leadership team because &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-engaging-people&quot; title=&quot;engaging people&quot;&gt;most leaders know where they are heading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;strategy execution rarely meets expectations&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2---evolve-the-strategy-tree-be-agile&quot;&gt;step #2 - evolve the strategy tree, be agile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need the strategy tree to be perfect.  You just need to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step #2 is to switch from static strategy documents, spreadsheets, email and chat groups, to collaborating in real-time off the strategy tree.  Collaboration without chaos.  Collaboration with context and structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the leadership team master this, you are then ready to move onto OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;okrs-are-brilliant---but-you-wont-stop-doing-strategy&quot;&gt;OKRs are brilliant - but you won’t stop doing strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makes sense right?  Whilst OKRs drive strategy execution for the next month or quarter, you are still evolving your strategy for the next 12 to 36 months, right?  Of course you are, as you should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This real-world attribute fundamentally sets #stratapp apart from the plethora of single-use-OKR-apps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The strategy tree is alive and interactive, and is powered by the &lt;em&gt;6 elements of collaboration*&lt;/em&gt;.  You can continue to evolve the strategy without losing alignment and engagement at all levels of the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Execution of the OKRs takes place in the same digital workspace.  OKRs are not just a pretty dashboard of targets and roll-up calculations to track people.  OKR execution is actually taking place inside #stratapp, also powered by the &lt;em&gt;6 elements of collaboration&lt;/em&gt;.  This rapidly elevates performance and culture, not to mention sustaining OKR adoption - empowering leaders at all levels with the opportunity to proactively lead, supporting their teams where it matters most.  You also see the rising stars, without the distortion of hierarchy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*The &lt;em&gt;6 elements of collaboration&lt;/em&gt; elegantly combined into &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;social with structure &amp;amp; context&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;live meeting notes, files &amp;amp; links&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ideas &amp;amp; challenges for crowdsourcing innovation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;initiative/project workboards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sub-tasks, tasks &amp;amp; personal workspace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;risk management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3---workshop-a---one-digital-workspace&quot;&gt;step #3 - Workshop A - one digital workspace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this 60min hands-on Workshop A, you aim to have the leadership team comfortable with working in &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt; with respect to strategy, which means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creating and evolving the strategy tree (remembering step #2)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;powering the strategy tree with &lt;em&gt;6 elements of collaboration&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;understanding security/confidentiality and how to leverage @org-design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;running meetings and meeting actions - with context and structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like learning a new language or preparing for a big sporting event, the leadership team then jump in and commit to doing this daily for the 7-21 days following Workshop A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, at this step #3 we still have the OKRs module in #stratapp turned off, so there is no problem adding other people from outside of the leadership team to collaborate on meetings/tasks/initiatives and the strategy tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4---workshop-b---big-bang-value&quot;&gt;step #4 - Workshop B - big bang value&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 7-21 days mastering &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt;, your leadership team will start to see several new opportunities for big bang value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step #4 is to embrace these insights by running an expansive Workshop B to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shape those ideas and opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share global best practices (we, or our partners, aim to add value here without compromising the confidentiality or IP of other clients)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop B aligns the leadership team on evolving their &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt;.  Thus providing clarity and consensus, before moving onto the next phase of adding the OKR methodology and cascading OKRs org-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implement-okrs---regrouping&quot;&gt;implement OKRs - regrouping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With solid alignment of the leadership team and real-time collaboration in &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt;, your organization is now ready to embrace the brilliant OKR methodology for strategy execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you conclude that alignment and real-time collaboration has not yet been achieved, you may decide to regroup and apply one or both of these strategy pages inside #stratapp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;our why - &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/how-great-leaders-inspire-action-by-simon-sinek/&quot; title=&quot;Simon Sinek&quot;&gt;Simon Sinek’s&lt;/a&gt; framework for establishing a solid belief foundation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;direction - &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/professor-roger-martin-on-what-ceos-should-really-be-doing/&quot; title=&quot;Professor Roger Martin&quot;&gt;Professor Roger Martin’s&lt;/a&gt; framework for setting a direction, so that the leadership team and management can shape the strategy tree and strategy execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In #stratapp, you can turn pages on/off by team or individual - you don’t have to change your business to suit the app - so you don’t have to apply these “our why” and “direction” pages as part of regrouping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach to achieving alignment is up to you, as you know what will work best for your leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implement-okrs---run-the-first-period-with-the-leadership-team-only&quot;&gt;implement OKRs - run the first period with the leadership team only&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although OKRs are all about &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-engaging-people&quot; title=&quot;engaging people&quot;&gt;engaging everyone&lt;/a&gt;, success starts at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, starting with the leadership team is the primary focus of steps 1 to 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-5---start-with-the-leadership-team&quot;&gt;step #5 - start with the leadership team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the leadership team now aligned on the strategy tree and thriving together in &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt;, the next step is to agree OKRs for the first period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most organizations opt for a quarterly OKR cycle, however early-stage companies may prefer monthly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your first OKR period, we recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting with no more than 2x OKRs and 2-4x key results per OKR&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allocating ownership of each objective and key result to different members of the leadership team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding all leadership team members on each objective and key result card - you won’t do this later, but for this first OKR period it is important&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keeping the security level on each to the lowest level, where you’re able to do so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each objective and key result card will then be powered by the &lt;em&gt;6 elements of collaboration&lt;/em&gt; in #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may involve adding employees who are outside of the leadership team.  As mentioned above, you can collaborate effectively without yet publishing the OKR module outside of the leadership team.  This is another real-world attribute of #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-many-okrs&quot;&gt;how many OKRs?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many OKRs should we set each month or quarter?  Less is more, as explained &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/how-many-OKRs/&quot; title=&quot;how many OKRs?&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also want to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/top-5-don'ts-on-OKRs/&quot; title=&quot;top 5 don'ts on OKRs&quot;&gt;top 5 don’ts on OKRs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implement-okrs---progressively&quot;&gt;implement OKRs - progressively&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick here is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to announce you are “&lt;em&gt;rolling out OKRs&lt;/em&gt;”, as that tends to create a mixed reaction from employees.  Most people who are new to OKRs misunderstand the methodology and why it is so brilliant for the organization, and for them as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend you go for an approach that is less threatening and more aspirational:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;our leadership team have recently been working together in one digital workspace for ideation + planning + strategy + execution, and now we want to progressively open that up to the whole company, so we can evolve these together with you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you add employees at each stage of the rollout, you may decide to share these two presentations: &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-engaging-people&quot; title=&quot;engaging people&quot;&gt;engaging people&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-the-leadership-cycle&quot; title=&quot;the leadership cycle&quot;&gt;the leadership cycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-6---cascading-one-digital-workspace&quot;&gt;step #6 - cascading one digital workspace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend cascading your rollout of the &lt;em&gt;one digital workspace&lt;/em&gt; in 5 stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rollout stage 1 - leadership team - top 10 to 15 people (fewer for small companies)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rollout stage 2 - expand to 25 (count includes the leadership team)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rollout stage 3 - expand to 50&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rollout stage 4 - expand to 250&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rollout stage 5 - org-wide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend allowing 2 to 3 weeks in between each rollout stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At each rollout stage you turn on the ideation, OKR and strategy modules.  For people you add before their rollout stage, you would typically limit their access to social and workspace - which in themselves are a game changer for elevating culture, collaboration and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This progressive rollout approach solves three aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leaders at each level in the organization get to lead by example - not just at the easy beginning, but all of the way through to successful adoption and having a positive impact on strategy execution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Context, collaboration and cadence improves progressively - learning as you go&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When employees are added, there is “&lt;em&gt;movement at the station&lt;/em&gt;” - an old saying from Australian sheep and cattle farmers - that is, a reason to be there and engage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-7---okr-consultants-skilled-in-change&quot;&gt;step #7 - OKR consultants skilled in change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cascading OKRs, most larger companies will hire an OKR coach who has a background in change management consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel that’s the right choice for your organization, we recommend engaging the consultant just before rollout stage 3; of the 5 rollout stages listed at step #6 above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stages 1 and 2 beforehand will give you great insight to the challenges you may or may not be facing, and the profile of consultant you need to hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implement-okrs---remuneration&quot;&gt;implement OKRs - remuneration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most practitioners, including the father of OKRs, Intel’s Andy Grove, and the pioneers since, firmly believe that remuneration should be decoupled from OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At #stratapp, we share the same view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want people to take risks and to strive for objectives that are ambitious and motivating. That’s how you transform organizations, create new markets and innovate beyond what competitors believe is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discuss this further in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/OKRs-vs-KPIs/&quot; title=&quot;OKRs vs KPIs&quot;&gt;the difference between OKRs vs KPIs vs remuneration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>how many OKRs should we set each month or quarter?</title>
        <subheading>OKRs are about focus and execution - less is more</subheading>
        <category>#okr</category>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-many-okr-objectives&quot;&gt;how many OKR objectives?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We admire the real world explanation &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/xaH2tMQzyjA&quot; title=&quot;Vivino's founder on OKRs&quot;&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt; by Vivino’s founder, Heini Zachariassen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For less than 100 employees, we recommend no more than 1 or 2 OKR objectives per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each grouping of 500 employees above that, we recommend 2 to 4 OKR objectives per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rolling-out-okrs-org-wide&quot;&gt;rolling out OKRs org-wide&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide to rollout OKRs to every employee, you can do that easily in #stratapp because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKRs can be organized around your org design - then filtered by org design, your teams, you and status&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Key Results can be cascaded down to multiple levels, with the progress automatically rolling up to calculate the progress at each level&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKRs can align to any level of your strategy tree, or be standalone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKR execution takes place in the same workspace - so you can get it done and leaders can support their teams with encouragement, feedback and removing blockers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you do this, please read &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/top-5-don'ts-on-OKRs/&quot; title=&quot;top 5 don'ts on OKRs&quot;&gt;top 5 don’ts on OKRs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-so-few-okr-objectives&quot;&gt;why so few OKR objectives?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs are about focusing your resources on objectives that are ambitious and inspiring. Objectives that your people and teams can rally behind, in a way that captures their imagination on what might be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than running 10 or 20 projects concurrently, the OKR philosophy is to channel your valuable time, energy, creativity, intellect and hard work into just 1 or 2 things that really matter. Doing this aligns everybody and it should create a massive positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fuel a thriving culture of creativity, risk taking and open collaboration, best practice is to completely decouple OKRs from employee remuneration (which we talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/OKRs-vs-KPIs/&quot; title=&quot;decoupling OKRs from remuneration&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst you may have many KPIs, less is more when it comes to OKRs (see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/OKRs-vs-KPIs/&quot; title=&quot;OKRs vs KPIs&quot;&gt;OKRs vs KPIs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-many-key-results-per-okr&quot;&gt;how many key results per OKR?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most OKR objectives can be measured with 2 to 3 key results per objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In #stratapp, you can cascade key results below each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, we recommend stopping at two levels of key results below each objective. In most cases, one level of key results will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ownership-of-okrs&quot;&gt;ownership of OKRs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can assign different owners to objectives and their cascading key results in #stratapp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add members and guest users to each objective and key result card; of course, guest users can only see the cards they have been added to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is powered by org design, so you can add org design attributes to each objective and key result. This allows you to filter the OKR dashboard by org design - so you can quickly view the progress of the company, your teams and the OKRs you own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp powered by org design also means the app can seamlessly scale with clients from 5 to 500,000 employees.  You don’t have to remember people’s names in order to collaborate with them, and to make sure that they’re not left out or behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;confidentiality-on-okrs&quot;&gt;confidentiality on OKRs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best practice is to run your OKR program transparently, company-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp makes this easy, but you can also control who can see what if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, the 4 levels of security inside #stratapp, also apply to our OKR module.  That is, the creator/assignor/owner of each objective or key result can select 1 of 4 levels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;restricted &lt;em&gt;- visible org-wide, anyone can contribute to the right-hand-side social section on each card&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;confidential &lt;em&gt;- visible to members only, members can invite members&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;secret &lt;em&gt;- visible to members only, only the owner can invite members&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;top secret &lt;em&gt;- same as secret, guest users cannot be invited&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;progressive-rollouts-of-okrs&quot;&gt;progressive rollouts of OKRs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp also allows you to rollout your OKR implementation progressively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you might want to share all or part of the strategy tree, but for the first two quarters keep the OKR rollout limited to the top 3 levels of management - until you get a better feel for the methodology and how best to apply it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again the power of having org design built into #stratapp comes into play.  You can easily turn on/off the different modules of #stratapp, selecting who can see what based on your org design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, most clients start with social and work collaboration, then add ideation, the strategy tree and OKRs, then the “our why” and “direction” pages under strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/7-steps-to-successfully-implement-OKRs/&quot; title=&quot;implement OKRs in 7 steps&quot;&gt;how to successfully implement OKRs in 7 steps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>the difference between OKRs vs KPIs and remuneration</title>
        <subheading>OKRs vs KPIs, the difference and why it matters for strategy execution and HR</subheading>
        <category>#okr</category>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-kpi&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what is a KPI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPI is an abbreviation for Key Performance Indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPIs measure the performance of an element or an activity over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPIs are usually tracked over several months or years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some common examples of KPIs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Revenue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Website visitors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sales conversion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employee satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employee turnover&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer net promoter score&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Current asset ratio&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Debt to equity ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KPIs are often reported on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_scorecard&quot; title=&quot;Balanced Scorecard&quot;&gt;balanced scorecard&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure the organization is taking a balanced approach to measuring performance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/balanced-scorecard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;balanced scorecard 9 quadrants&quot; title=&quot;balanced scorecard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-an-okr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what is an OKR?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKR is an abbreviation for objectives and key results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OKR methodology was created by Intel’s founder, Andy Grove, and since brought to fame by &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;John Doerr&lt;/a&gt; and the founders of Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs are brilliant for strategy execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectives clearly state what you want to achieve. They are aspirational and qualitative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Results measure outcomes. They are tangible and quantitative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OKRs usually have a lifetime of one quarter, with weekly check-ins on progress during the quarter. Early-stage companies may choose to run OKRs monthly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okrs-vs-kpis---what-is-the-difference&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OKRs vs KPIs - what is the difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have a KPI that measures revenue-per-month. Let’s say your revenue is currently $10m/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a strategic planning session, you set a one-year goal to double revenue to $20m/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goal setting is easy. Execution is where the going gets tough and value is created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your $20m/month strategic goal in mind, you can now set your objectives for the next quarter. This may take some research, brainstorming and workshops. Let’s say at the conclusion of these planning activities, you agree on one objective to rally behind for the next quarter, to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;solve how to make our baby pram products smart-prams that Australian parents will love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key results measure the outcome of your objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key results provide clarity on how you will evaluate whether or not the &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; has been achieved. Google is famous for making their post-quarter reviews of OKRs binary, asking themselves:&lt;br /&gt;
“&lt;em&gt;Did we achieve the objective, yes or no?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, let’s say you set the following &lt;em&gt;key results&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;200,000 downloads of our design brochure to unique IP addresses in Australia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50,000 Australian based parents sign up to receive our pre-launch offer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now your team will have a clear focus and common understanding of expectations for the next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lifespan-and-impact-of-okrs-vs-kpis&quot;&gt;lifespan and impact of OKRs vs KPIs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst your KPIs may run for several months or years, OKRs drive strategy execution for the current quarter - aligning the energy, creativity, intellect and hard work of everyone in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategy execution through OKRs may impact several KPIs of the organization, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Revenue per Month - moving towards our strategic goal to double revenue to $20m/month within one year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Number of Pre-Orders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employee Satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brand Awareness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why it is acceptable to have manual updating of actuals for OKRs. OKRs usually have a lifetime of one quarter, so automation is less important. In fact, many OKR thought leaders and consultants say that having OKR owners update the progress and actuals on their OKRs each week, is a discipline that positively impacts performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst most organizations will only set 1 to 5 OKRs for a quarter (which you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratappsaas.com/blog/how-many-OKRs/&quot; title=&quot;how many OKRs&quot;&gt;read about here&lt;/a&gt;), there are likely to be a hundred or more KPIs that get tracked for several months or years. For this reason we are now seeing some brilliant innovations in BI tools that can pull live KPI data from several different systems, into custom reports with configurable alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okrs-vs-kpis---why-does-it-matter&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OKRs vs KPIs - why does it matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One great advantage of the OKR methodology is that it fuels creativity, risk taking, rapid learning and ambition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most practitioners, including the father of OKRs, Intel’s Andy Grove, and the pioneers since, firmly believe that remuneration should be decoupled from OKRs. At #stratapp, we share the same view. You want people to take risks and to strive for objectives that are ambitious and motivating. That’s how you transform organizations, create new markets and innovate beyond what competitors believe is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decoupling-okrs-from-remuneration&quot;&gt;decoupling OKRs from remuneration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t want OKRs to get caught up in the typical scenario that happens with KPIs. For example, the:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CEO and Sales Director meet to agree sales targets and a bonus plan for next year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sales Director thinks they can do $50-60m revenue, so he opens by suggesting a target of $30m&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CEO proposes a 2.5% bonus on revenue for the Sales Director, on sales achieved above $30m&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sales Director negotiates that threshold down to $20m, and wrangles in an extra bonus of another 2.5% if the sales exceed $40m (a target 33% below what he is privately aiming for)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That gets documented and the game continues, year on year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, you don’t want that age-old human dynamic taking place every quarter on OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want people to dream, be creative and really strive to take the organization to new levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t hit every key result, the collective impact of rallying everyone behind quarterly OKRs will move the organization forward on strategy execution like never before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-from-vivino-on-reviewing-okrs&quot;&gt;learning from Vivino on reviewing OKRs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, in designing the OKR module for #stratapp, we have applied a learning from the founder of Vivino (short video &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/xaH2tMQzyjA&quot; title=&quot;Vivino's founder on OKRs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). That is, in #stratapp, when you review your OKRs during and at the end of the OKR period, you can assign a simple ‘smiley face’ outcome for the review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;happy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;neutral&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;not happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the team leaders and executives get to apply some judgement, alongside the Google-style binary assessment of whether or not the OKR was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, even if we are behind on several key results sitting below an objective, we may be very happy with where we have landed overall in relation to that objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This functionality, and how you apply it, is a key ingredient to building culture and making sure your objectives are ambitious and motivating each quarter. In #stratapp, we recommend making these ‘smiley face’ reviews part of your weekly and monthly check-ins with the OKR owners and their teams.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 reasons #stratapp is the world's best OKR software app right now</title>
        <subheading>why do OKR implementations fail and which is the best OKR software app?</subheading>
        <category>#okr</category>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2018 there has been a plethora of single-use-apps for OKRs. The good ones have pretty much the same approach and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp takes OKRs to a whole new level, because #stratapp &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; a single-use-OKR-app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 reasons why #stratapp is the world’s best OKR software application right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKRs are driven off the interactive strategy tree&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OKR execution takes place in the same digital workspace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your teams can balance their time between strategy execution and daily work - this is the secret to succeeding (or failing) on OKRs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interactive-strategy-tree-for-okrs&quot;&gt;interactive strategy tree for OKRs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp is the world’s first app to bring all five stages of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/stratapp-the-leadership-cycle&quot; title=&quot;The Leadership Cycle&quot;&gt;The Leadership Cycle&lt;/a&gt; into one digital workspace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/the-leadership-cycle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-tree-context-for-okrs&quot;&gt;strategy tree context for OKRs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a strategy tree is the easiest way to engage employees on going from vision and direction, to strategy execution. Best practice is to take a 1 to 3 year time horizon for the strategy tree, to write them in a “verb noun” format and to strive for 3 to 6 branches at each level of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is simplicity and structure but no fixed rules in #stratapp, so you can run #stratapp in a way that suits your business.  This makes your time-to-value days, rather than months or quarters. Once you create your strategy tree, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start executing at any point in the tree; or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hang OKRs at any point in the tree; or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do a mix of both&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of hanging OKRs off your strategy tree, is that your teams then have an overall context for the OKR. Everyone can see the answer to the one burning question that arises during those tough moments on strategy execution: “Remind me again, why are we doing this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okrs-in-one-digital-workspace&quot;&gt;OKRs in one digital workspace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some single-use-apps for OKR claim to enable OKR execution, but that’s either a myth or an exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything you ended to drive OKR execution sits inside #stratapp, in one seamless digital workspace, powered by 6 elements of collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/6-elements-of-collaboration.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;benefits-of-one-digital-workspace-for-okrs&quot;&gt;benefits of one digital workspace for OKRs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having everything you need to execute OKRs in one digital workspace provides two enormous benefits for your business, leaders and team members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Subject to your chosen security settings) execution is transparent to everyone, thus rapidly accelerating accountability and performance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engagement is elevated, as there are many reasons to be there inside the app - rather than that annoying experience of having to remember to open a single-use-OKR app just to update progress or actuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;balancing-time-between-strategy-execution-and-daily-work-with-okrs&quot;&gt;balancing time between strategy execution and daily work with OKRs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp helps solve this age old problem, which existed well before the concept of OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/balancing-strategy-and-daily-execution.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most leaders and motivated employees are great at ideation, planning and coming up with a 1 to 3 year strategy tree. In fact, many studies have shown how leaders of all demographics rate themselves highly on their ability to do those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is execution. As Chris Sacca, an investor in Twitter and Uber, famously said:&lt;br /&gt;
“&lt;em&gt;Ideas are cheap, execution is everything!&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solving-the-challenge-of-okr-execution&quot;&gt;solving the challenge of OKR execution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving this challenge goes to the heart of the #stratapp thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can bring everything you need to do on strategy formulation, strategy execution, learning, time management and daily work, into one digital workspace - that has consistent user experience across each of those features - then we will empower each employee to optimize their own balance between working on strategy and getting their day to day work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We achieve this by reducing (or eliminating) integrations, app switching, data silos and misalignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way we happen to save you 17 to 35 times on per user SaaS fees, and that saving will increase further as we deliver on the #stratapp product roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our thesis is simple: &lt;em&gt;strategy execution wins on employee engagement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#stratapp makes it easy for you to align everyone in a way they feel empowered and part of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone can see how what they are working on contributes to the overall goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No chaos. No confusion. No excuses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone aligned. Everyone motivated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
