  has been top down and broken for years, not anymore.

    Traditionally the board or CEO would formulate strategy, then communicate it in two static documents - one describing the strategy, the other setting targets. Some companies do this as annual offsite events. Some do it with consultants. Some invite middle management. Some invite the whole company.

    Regardless of the approach, two things fail:

    1. **Urgent takes over important** - people donâ€™t have the skill, will or time to focus on strategy execution, and pretty soon day to day priorities consume everyone
    2. **Out of date** - whilst the strategy sounded great, within a few weeks or months it no longer matches what the organization focuses on

    When email was first invented it consumed about 5% of our time and a reasonable response time was 7 days.

    Email and messaging apps are now a real time medium, consuming 40% of our time, with another 45-55% lost to meetings, routine tasks and being reactive.

    Executives, managers and team leaders are fast losing the headspace to think deeply, plan carefully, experiment and flawlessly execute on strategy, new capabilities and change.

## **becoming agile on strategy execution**

world's first app to enable org-wide collaboration at any level in the strategy tree

you are not constrained by rules, at an ylevel int he tree you can add  
\- KPIs; workboards ....

people get used to the format = fast and agile

## **KPIs/OKRs that cascade for strategy execution**

\#stratapp caters for both types of KPIs/OKRs in an organization.  Those that relate to the strategy tree hierarchy, and those that relate to general operations.

In both cases you can cascade the KPI/OKR hierarchy, separate to the strategy tree hierarchy.  As beautifully ariculated by Richard Rumelt in Good Strategy Bad Stratwegy, setting targets is not strategy.  The strategy tree reflects your strategy.  The KPI/OKR tree reflects your targets.

For example, you might have a strategic goal to grow market share in Europe.  The strategy tree will show the strategy of how you plan to achieve that goal.  You might set a KPI to grow European revenue to $100m within 3 years, and the source of that KPI being the goal will make that a strategic KPI.  Below that KPI you are free to cascade the KPI as you see fit, independent of the strategy tree.  For example, you might cascade the KPI targets by region (Scandinavia, Benelux and Germany), then by country, then by state.

## **achieving employee engagement on strategy execution**

20, 100 or 1,000 employees cannot collaborate on a document or presentation that articulates strategy.  Most employees won't even read it.

\#stratapp makes your strategy alive and accessible toeveryone.
