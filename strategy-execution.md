    Traditionally the board or CEO would formulate strategy, then communicate it in two static documents - one describing the strategy, the other setting targets. Some companies do this as annual offsite events. Some do it with consultants. Some invite middle management. Some invite the whole company.

    Regardless of the approach, two things fail:

    1. **Urgent takes over important** - people donâ€™t have the skill, will or time to focus on strategy execution, and pretty soon day to day priorities consume everyone
    2. **Out of date** - whilst the strategy sounded great, within a few weeks or months it no longer matches what the organization focuses on

    When email was first invented it consumed about 5% of our time and a reasonable response time was 7 days.

    Email and messaging apps are now a real time medium, consuming 40% of our time, with another 45-55% lost to meetings, routine tasks and being reactive.

    Executives, managers and team leaders are fast losing the headspace to think deeply, plan carefully, experiment and flawlessly execute on strategy, new capabilities and change.

## **strategy execution articulated as a tree hierarchy**

For everyone in your organziation to understand and collaborate on strategy execution, best practice is to represent the strategy as a tree hierarchy.

This template is built into #stratapp as goals > objectives > actions > projects.

This [video](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/strategic-planning-software-with-a-strategy-tree-hierarchy/ "tips for strategy execution comms") explains two tips for communicating strategy:

* 3 to 6 rule - for each level in the tree hierarchy (e.g. 3 overall goals, that each break down to 3 to 6 objectives, and so on)
* verb noun rule - express each in verb noun format (e.g. "develop our ...", "improve our ...", "solve how to ...")

\#stratapp offers unparalleled flexibility. You can create strategy trees for unlimited combinations of org design (geography, functions, verticals and horizontals), and at any level in the tree hierarchy you can invite people to collaborate on KPIs, workboards, risks, meetings, tasks, files and links.

Most importantly, all social collaboration on strategy execution has both [structure and context.](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/atlassian-stride-social-with-structure/ "Atlassian thought of it, stratapp did it")  For example, in seconds you can jump to "any questions or decisions made on strategic goals in the last 72 hours."

### vision and why - context for strategy execution

\#stratapp allows you to turn on/off the pages for strategic context.

You might choose to articulate the vision, mission and values.

Or you may prefer to use the brilliant [start with why](https://simonsinek.com/ "start with why") construct from Simon Sinek, which is built into #stratapp.

### winning aspiration & where to play

\#stratapp also includes the templates developed by [Prof Roger Martin](https://rogerlmartin.com/meet-roger "Prof Roger Martin"), in collaboration with [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/ "Deloitte") and [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/ "Harvard Business Review").

Prof Martin argues that CEOs and business owners should focus on getting right the strategic choices, so their leaders and teams have a clear frame of reference for strategy execution and innovation. This template is included in #stratapp under the "direction" page, allowing you to articulate:

* winning aspiration
* where to play
* how to win
* capabilities

Then the strategy tree hierarchy inside #stratapp becomes the place to articulate, innovate, evolve and collaborate on strategy execution, against that frame of reference.

## **be agile on strategy execution**

Hardly a week goes by without a management article or high profile blog post talking to the need for organizations to become agile.  If you study those, you'll start to see a pattern - the talk is all about the why, benefits and learnings from becoming agile.  There is little or no mention of how exactly how to achieve it, especially if you have 50 to 500,000 employees.

\#stratapp provides you the how.  #stratapp makes your time to value on agile days, rather than weeks or months.  #stratapp makes agile sustainable.

\#stratapp is designed for org-wide execution and collaboration, within the context of strategy.  This is the key to becoming and sustaining a culture of agile.  If you don't have context and structure, the collaboration eventually becomes a fire-hose of distraction and noise.

\#stratapp allows you to embrace agile as an org-wide capability for shaping, testing and evolving strategy execution, at speed.

## **cascading KPIs/OKRs for strategy execution**

\#stratapp caters for both types of KPIs/OKRs in an organization.  Those that relate to the strategy tree hierarchy, and those that relate to general operations.

In both cases you can cascade the KPI/OKR hierarchy, separate to the strategy tree hierarchy.  As beautifully ariculated by Richard Rumelt in Good Strategy Bad Stratwegy, setting targets is not strategy.  The strategy tree reflects your strategy.  The KPI/OKR tree reflects your targets.

For example, you might have a strategic goal to grow market share in Europe.  The strategy tree will show the strategy of how you plan to achieve that goal.  You might set a KPI to grow European revenue to $100m within 3 years, and the source of that KPI being the goal will make that a strategic KPI.  Below that KPI you are free to cascade the KPI as you see fit, independent of the strategy tree.  For example, you might cascade the KPI targets by region (Scandinavia, Benelux and Germany), then by country, then by state.

## **achieving employee engagement on strategy execution**

20, 100, 1,000 or 50,000 employees cannot collaborate on a strategy document or presentation.  Let's be honest, most employees won't even read it.

\#stratapp makes your strategy alive and accessible to everyone.

By making the strategy tree alive and interactive at all levels, you naturally create employee engagement on strategy execution.  People at all levels of the organization can ask questions, contribute ideas, identify risks and volunteer to get involved.

You immediately get to tap into the talents and potential of everyone.

By 2025, 75% of the workforce will be millennials.  To get inside their heads on radical transparency and work collaboration, you might enjoy this article characterising why [we 45-55yr olds are the problem](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/millennials/ "millennials and collaboration").

## **breaking the comms hierarchy on innovation & strategy execution**

Elon Musk has 6 productivity rules at Tesla, and rule #5 is "Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done, not through the 'chain of command' ... It must be ok for people to talk directly and just make the right things happen."

At #stratapp, we share the same view.  The hierarchy is there to allocate responsibility, for example, spending limits, or looking after a team or process.

But communication should be free flowing and open.  That said, we don't want to create a twitter or #slack style fire-hose of social posts, because in the end that creates chaos and distraction.

\#stratapp has social with structure and context. We were not the first to think of this social with structure, and [we give full credit to Atlassian in this article](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/atlassian-stride-social-with-structure/ "social with structure"), however we are the first and only B2B SaaS app to bring it to market.

But social with structure is only half the story.  We also have social with context, and that context can either be the strategy tree hierarchy, or the KPIs, workboards, tasks, risks, ideas or challenges hanging off it, or it could be the day to day work.

By design, #stratapp has solved 3 things at once:

1. Engaging employees on strategy execution, because they can do strategic and day to day work in one app - #stratapp adds value to every employee at every level (including simple things like meetings, tasks, workboards and what they've got on this week), making it worth their while to engage
2. Executives, leaders and teams can collaborate efficiently - with just the right level of structure and context, to save time without hindering engagement
3. Breaking free of the traditional comms hierarchy - tapping into the whole talent pool on innovation and evolving strategy execution - whilst at the same time elevating culture and org/team/individual performance

## **proactively managing risks on strategy execution**

For most organizations, risk management is all talk, no action.

If it was made easier, most of us would embrace risk management.  But it's not, [so we pass the monkey to our CFOs](https://stratappsaas.com/blog/why-we-lump-our-cfos-with-risk-management/ "passing the risk management monkey to CFOs").

\#stratapp makes risk management easy, org-wide and natural.

You can easily track risks on both strategy execution and day to day work.  

Similar to our design philosophy on other features, #stratapp applies what you already know, so that your time to value is days, not weeks, months or quarters.  The CFO monkey link above lists the 10 components of risk management inside #stratapp - things like status, impact, probability and mitigations - as you read that list, you'll realise you already know them.

\#stratapp makes it easy for you to proactively manage risks on strategy execution, at all levels of the organization.

## **key questions for strategy execution**

Our [starting with why](https://bit.ly/starting-with-why-not-how "starting with why") presentation finishes with 3 key questions on strategy execution:

1. What are the top 3 pain points?
2. How will these change next 5 years?
3. What top 3 things are holding back strategy execution?

The slide before that articulates the employee's perspective: 

_we have plenty of apps, but there is nothing to run the actual company_

_we want to collaborate on shared goals and plans, not get bogged down in single-use-apps and noise_

We believe that if you ask yourself those key questions, and conclude that they are worth solving, then you will love #stratapp.

Love work.  Love life.

Be effective.  Anywhere.  Anytime.

Everything you need, in your pocket.
